# Test evidence

## Whole-app refinement — 2026-10-08

- Full pinned local validation passes: **261 tests (39 policy + 222 application)**,
  format/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13 web routes. Nine new
  history-presentation and three new design-policy regressions. Final log:
  ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/app-refinement-validate.log`.
- Both actual-UI browser runners pass with installed Playwright/Chrome.
  FI/EN, manual invalid/no-request and keyboard activation, distinct product
  failure/offline/missing states, two-component resolved/unknown fixture with
  provenance/licence, local ambiguity/confirmation/history/drafts/legal markers,
  dark/130% synthetic text and 320/390/1280 Home widths. Nearby retains map-first,
  offline/source/unknown safeguards using synthetic public-point GPS.
- Current Metro iOS manifest and its exact launch asset both return HTTP 200;
  development JS bundle is 10,958,874 bytes. Local API `/v1/health` returns
  `status=ok`, version 0.1.0. This establishes local service/bundle generation,
  not new physical startup or a native/release build.
- Final exported web entry `entry-817cc3f3545fc2533f84ad89cd3d8437.js`:
  3,372,352 bytes / 696,516 bytes gzip, still above the existing 2 MiB warning
  budget. No measured load-time, native performance or battery improvement claim.
- Visual inspection, exact reproducible commands, repaired overflow/test-selector
  defects and fixture limitations: `APP_REFINEMENT_EVIDENCE.md`. No new native
  build/device acceptance, performance/battery benchmark, live provider/security
  audit, GitHub CI or release claim. No push in this work unit.

## Authorized team publication preflight — 2026-10-08

- Fresh full pinned `pnpm validate` passes, exit 0: 249 tests (36 policy + 213 application), format/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13 routes. Log: ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/team-push-validate-2026-10-08.log`.
- Actual `git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/main` succeeds without force: `39f8aa6..3df2437`. Remote main confirmed `3df2437be5df3c20a1e7134867f9a966f691543f`. GitHub API identifies existing repository as public/default main; visibility unchanged. Immediate workflow query returns no runs yet, not a CI success. Follow-up evidence commit belongs to the same explicitly authorized sharing step; no private-repository push or production release.

- Explicit owner authorization names KierratysAppi. Fresh remote main is `39f8aa65b72befcb43c5c1440dbca1b02b335edf`, an ancestor of implementation `0324c0d0f78f0218b5c95c4b33c8df20eac12a98` (0 remote-only / 10 local-only commits). Reviewed history/diff, clean worktree and passing aggregate whitespace check. Changed filename inventory includes no environment/credential artifacts, screenshots/work directories or built native app. Not a secret-scanner or production release pass.

## Nearby UX and theme coherence — 2026-10-08

- Final post-runner/shared-disabled-state rerun also passes, exit 0: same 249 tests and all validation gates. Log: ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/nearby-ux-validate-complete-2026-10-08.log`. Committed browser runner also passes using Enter to expand the focused details control, then collapses it again. No new physical-device evidence.

- Full pinned `pnpm validate` passes, exit 0: **249 tests (36 policy + 213 application)**, formatting/lint/strict types, builds and 13 web routes. Passing log: ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/nearby-ux-validate-final-2026-10-08.log`. Three new policy cases protect primary map ordering, visible uncertainty/optional consent/loading, expanded ARIA and single reactive theme.
- Optional committed runner `scripts/qa/nearby-ux-browser.cjs` runs against actual Metro 8093 with installed Playwright/Chrome. Synthetic geolocation is at a public bundled point; no user location or native result is read. FI/EN, unknown metadata, map button within the initial 390×844 viewport, details false→true→false, offline local re-search, precise/approximate display and reduced-motion preference pass. Screenshot inspection covers FI light/dark, EN and 130% synthetic browser text with no horizontal overflow; not iOS Dynamic Type.
- Browser run initially exposed missing aria-expanded, repaired with explicit ARIA in addition to native state. Live dark-switch assertion then failed: text/surfaces inconsistent. Shared root AppThemeProvider fixes it; exact screen background RGB(20,34,27) now passes after the media change. Initial QA selector for English incorrectly used button instead of radio and was repaired; this was a test selector issue, not a product defect.
- Screenshots are ignored `work/nearby-ux-qa/{fi-light,fi-dark,fi-large,en}.png`; source runner and rerun procedure: `docs/design/NEARBY_UX.md`. No native OS address lookup/map handoff, actual VoiceOver, release build/store or production GO claim. No new network dependency or push.

## Optional point-area address — 2026-10-08

- Full pinned `pnpm validate` passes after removing an undeclared Zod import from the mobile normalizer and using explicit runtime guards: **246 tests (33 policy + 213 application)**, formatting/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13 routes. Initial typecheck failure is retained in ignored `point-address-validate-2026-10-08.log`; passing run: `work/location-2026-10-06/point-address-validate-final-2026-10-08.log`. Disclosure also appears in the privacy screen. Native service/handoff remains pending; no push.

- Added four tests: bounded address normalization/POI-name exclusion, exact public-coordinate-only lookup and unavailable/offline handling, stalled-provider deadline, pre-abort/in-flight cancellation. Existing identity policy updated for generic unnamed-point heading. No real reverse-geocoding result or physical layout/map-handoff pass claimed; no user coordinates recorded.

## Point map destination — 2026-10-08

- Full pinned `pnpm validate` passes both before and after final privacy-copy update, exit 0: **242 tests (33 policy + 209 application)**, formatting/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13 web routes. Logs: ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/point-map-validate-2026-10-08.log` and `point-map-validate-final-2026-10-08.log`. No new external blocker or production GO.

- Regression verifies exact public-point marker URL for a point lacking an address and rejects invalid coordinates. UI retains known address and adds explicit missing-address fallback/map action. FI/EN privacy copy distinguishes public point coordinates from user location. Native handoff/visual inspection remains pending; no user coordinates captured.

## Nearest-point identity — 2026-10-08

- Full pinned `pnpm validate` passes, exit 0: **241 tests (33 policy + 208 application)**, formatting/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13 web routes. Log: ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/point-identity-validate-2026-10-08.log`. No new external blocker or production GO claim.

- Added a policy regression covering source-provided name, explicit unknown fallback, centre/container/unknown type, address and source identifier rendering. Narrow policy suite passes 4 tests. This is source-level coverage, not a physical layout/accessibility pass. No new native result capture or location details retained; existing device evidence predates this UI change.

## Physical location recovery — 2026-10-08

- Post-permission-cycle full pinned `pnpm validate` passes, exit 0: same 240 tests, formatting/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13 routes. Ignored log: `work/location-2026-10-06/iphone-permission-validate-2026-10-08.log`. Application code remains unchanged.

- Permission restored: owner reports While Using the App; session `team-denial-2026-10-08` returns to nearby and searches. Exact ready-only button wait exits 0 and `is visible 'role="button" label="Päivitä sijainti"'` reports Passed. Scoped denial/restoration cycle passes. Closed only the named testing helper, not the product; no reinstall, location details or push. Earlier pending-restoration statements below describe the pre-restoration attempt.

- Subsequent owner-assisted denial test: Roope reported setting the app-specific location permission to Never. Session `team-denial-2026-10-08` taps the native search control and observes the full Finnish `nearbyPermission` message and **Avaa asetukset** button in a settled UI diff. Closing the screen returns to Home with scan/manual/guide controls present. Denied-state rendering and Home navigation pass; actual use of other features and permission restoration/retry are not yet verified. No location data captured.

- Full pinned `pnpm validate` passes, exit 0: 240 tests (32 policy + 208 application), formatting/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13 web routes. Log: ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/iphone-validate-2026-10-08.log`. Closed only the named automation helper/session afterward; local API/Metro remain available. No new live dependency-audit, release-build or store claim.

- Local API/Metro had stopped; restarted existing team-baseline artifacts. LAN health and iOS manifest/launch asset pass (HTTP 200, 10,954,638 bytes). Explicit development-client relaunch succeeds; native automation subsequently reads Home and nearby introduction.
- Two search actions followed by `wait 'role="button" label="Päivitä sijainti"' 25000` return exit 0. Source restricts that button to the ready state. Background/foreground then exposes `role="button" label="Etsi sijainnillani"`, with product PID 7054 unchanged: scoped native clearing pass, not a process-reset inference.
- Source/explanation label checks are inconclusive (unqualified selectors ambiguous; role="text" selectors unmatched). No full result tree/screenshot, coordinates, nearest-point details or exact distance retained. Fresh consent, denied recovery, physical accuracy and native provider UI remain unverified. Installed source remains 487af03; no push, reinstall or production GO.

## Owner-requested physical retry — 2026-10-07, 22:07 Finland time

- On unchanged installed source `487af03`, the existing helper's signature, phone unlock and API/Metro health pass. Fresh session `team-location-retry-2026-10-07` reaches its listener and reads Home in about 14 seconds; no additional build, install, reset or source change was needed.
- **Actual native Finnish Home and Home → nearby introduction pass** through semantic inspection/tap and screenshots. The introduction retains explicit one-shot/local-only location use, coverage/material/access/hours uncertainty, 6.10.2026 snapshot date and OSM/ODbL attribution. Inspected screenshots at 1284×2778 show no visible text clipping at the current font size; the development gear overlay is not production UI acceptance.
- Starting location was performed, but outcome is **unverified**: alert lookup returned none; safe result/refresh selectors did not match; subsequent captures hit `system_modal_probe_timeout` / `RUNNER_BUSY`. Failed/busy captures are not proof of an absent result, denial or app defect. Asked Roope for the actual permission/result/error state. No GPS, denial/retry, background clearing or native product-source pass is inferred.
- Evidence: ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/iphone-home-retry-2026-10-07.png` and `iphone-nearby-intro-retry-2026-10-07.png`, both captured before requesting location. No location-result/permission-map screenshot, coordinates, point address or actual distance retained. Exact scope and reproduction: `PHYSICAL_IOS_VALIDATION.md`. No GitHub push or release occurred.
- Full pinned `pnpm validate` after the evidence update **passes, exit 0**: 240 tests, formatting/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13 web routes. Log: ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/iphone-retry-validate-2026-10-07.log`. Closed the automation session by naming only its helper app; no runner xcodebuild remained, and a subsequent query confirmed the product's same PID still running. The app was not reinstalled, reset or terminated for this retry.

## Post-trust launch and automation limit — 2026-10-07

- Roope confirmed the trust/verification step. CoreDevice then launched the same installed app successfully; a later filtered process query found KeepItGreen running. **Initial security rejection resolved**, without another product build/install. API/Metro health passes; Home/GPS/source UI is not inferred from process presence.
- Agent-device 0.20.10 first failed to install its own cached runner because its profile had expired. Xcode 27 beta helper renewal succeeds; the changed outer resource seal was repaired using the existing signing identity/entitlements, followed by passing recursive strict verification. This is a separate testing helper, not new product code or a changed product profile.
- Subsequent fresh-session XCTest connection still times out without an inspectable tree. No automated Home or GPS pass, screenshot, coordinate or camera capture is claimed. Owner-visible Home/error/permission confirmation requested; exact next physical procedure is in `PHYSICAL_IOS_VALIDATION.md`/OA-09. Runner transport recovery remains local tooling work, not an external database/paid-account blocker.
- Full pinned **`pnpm validate` passes, exit 0**, 240 tests (32 policy + 208 application), all formatting/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13 web routes, including the post-documentation rerun. Logs: ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/iphone-post-trust-validate-2026-10-07.log` and `iphone-post-trust-validate-final-2026-10-07.log`. Application source remains `487af03`; documentation only changes in this work unit. No push or production release occurred.

## Native renewal and installation — 2026-10-07

- Source `487af03`, same independent team-baseline branch. Retained Xcode 26.6 Debug build now finishes with exit 0 and `BUILD SUCCEEDED`. Pod lock/manifest match. No application source changed in this installation work unit.
- Strict recursive signature plus all **12 embedded framework** checks pass. Embedded profile app/team/device binding and development entitlements match; expires **October 13, 21:21:19 Finland time**. Built Info.plist declares foreground location only, no Always purpose/background mode.
- Connected unlocked iPhone: `devicectl device install app` succeeds over the same bundle ID without uninstalling. Rollback is retained. Pre/post data-container paths differ; actual user-content retention is not independently verified.
- First launch **fails with iOS Security rejection** (signature/entitlement/trust alternatives), despite passing local signing checks. Roope was asked to check actual developer trust/verification. No Home, GPS, camera, native source UI or release pass is inferred from installation. Exact metadata and procedure: `PHYSICAL_IOS_VALIDATION.md`.
- API health/Metro status/iOS manifest and its exact JS launch asset pass; asset HTTP 200 and **10,956,460 bytes**. Host transport success is not evidence the phone executed it.
- Re-ran full pinned **`pnpm validate`: exit 0**, same **240 tests**, all formatting/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13-route export. Both the initial run and the post-documentation rerun pass; logs: ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/iphone-validate-2026-10-07.log` and `iphone-validate-final-2026-10-07.log`. No new Doctor, registry audit, native release, store, legal or production GO claim; no GitHub push.

## Independent team-baseline location/free-data work — 2026-10-06–07

- Base `39f8aa6`, local `codex/kierratysappi-nearest-location`. No KeepItGreen experiment code/assets copied and no GitHub push. Team checkout is separate from the private checkout.
- **Full pinned `pnpm validate` passes October 7**, exit 0: **240 tests** = 32 Node policy + 208 Vitest application tests in 28 files. Breakdown: domain 52, database 5, localization 4, recycling 8, providers 35, application 15, API 13, mobile 76. Format/lint/strict types, package/API builds and **13** web routes pass. Log: ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/data-validate.log`.
- New tests cover the entire bundled directory contract, import completeness/duplicate/coordinate/licence/access rules, nearest/tie/distance calculations, upstream-data age, foreground permission/cancel/timeout/watcher cleanup and FI/EN configuration. Universal-product regressions cover all three sibling types, fixed URL reconstruction, unsafe host/path/credentials/port/fragment, wrong GTIN/type, loops, shared quota/deadline, pre-cancellation and source-preserving API cache/missing-packaging results.
- Repairs during validation: HTTP fixture initially included a forbidden `country` field (corrected to the real strict API body); a Node filesystem import in the application-layer test was moved to a mobile JSON-contract test; cross-package TypeScript control-flow inference required explicit URL/Response/source types. Final checks pass without `any`, exclusions or loosened gates.
- Live official-source example (from the linked Open Facts tutorial): initial OFF 302 to `fi.openproductsfacts.org`; fixed-origin follow-up to `world.openproductsfacts.org` returns 200, actual source Open Products Facts, zero packaging components. Initial world-only routing failed closed; explicit FI/EN aliases were added with regressions. Beauty and pet-food have simulated contract coverage, **not** a separately verified live barcode.
- Browser at localhost 8093, real API at 3003: Finnish manual entry of the official public example → loading → **Pakkaustiedot puuttuvat**, with Open Products Facts source/link, ODbL 1.0, contributor attribution and 7.10.2026 retrieval date. No invented product name or sorting destination. Scoped Home FI/EN and English privacy inspection shows all four barcode recipients, the optional local-only location notice and legal-draft marker. Finnish nearby intro shows actual 6.10.2026 snapshot date and OSM attribution. No geolocation permission was granted or user position inspected.
- Browser screenshots inspected for the manual form and Finnish Home at the actual 319px viewport; no horizontal document overflow. Existing visual design retained. Browser pointer automation mis-targeted/no-op'd; keyboard Enter successfully exercised submit, close and locale controls. This is not a pointer, native, VoiceOver, dark/large-text, camera or GPS acceptance claim. FI Home restored and temporary viewport override reset. Screenshots were inspected in-tool, not archived as files.
- API was rebuilt and only its verified team-preview process restarted at 3003 with the identified project User-Agent and bounded web origins. Metro remains 8093. Debug still depends on Mac/network; data bundling does not establish a standalone native release.
- Web entry: **3,370,667 bytes / 696,736 gzip**, compared with September's 2,548,479 / 576,724. The bundled point database increases size; the existing 2 MiB warning remains, not a performance pass. Formatter max-size was raised to 3 MB so the full generated source data is checked, not excluded.
- At the end of the data work unit, October 6 Expo-location prebuild/pods passed but Xcode 26.6 compile was interrupted for low disk. Owner-approved October 7 cleanup freed approximately 10 GB and preserved the build/rollback. The later native section above supersedes that pending build/install state, not the still-pending physical location acceptance. No fresh Expo Doctor, registry audit, native release, legal/store approval or production GO is claimed.

## Post-push Expo/security repair — 2026-09-10

- Initial GitHub implementation run `34455323779` passed `pnpm validate` but **failed** Expo Doctor 19/20: required Expo ~57.0.21 and Router ~57.0.20, installed 57.0.19/57.0.18. Security run `34455323825` passed Gitleaks; CodeQL skipped. The first synchronized docs snapshot preceded that CI failure; it is not a claim of a green run.
- Updated only those direct Expo packages within SDK 57. Publication-age check from npm package metadata: both older than 42 hours. No Expo exclusions or age bypass. Added a policy regression retaining mandatory Doctor and preventing suppression.
- The recovered live registry audit returned **20 high / 0 critical / 10 moderate / 1 low** records, including 19 high xmldom records and one high js-yaml record. Narrow compatible transitive update selected xmldom 0.8.15/0.9.12 and js-yaml 4.3.2, all older than 24 hours. Two security-floor regressions plus existing fail-closed/high-advisory fixtures pass (**9/9 dependency-policy tests**).
- Final frozen install, peer check, `expo install --check` and `expo-doctor@1.20.1` **20/20** pass. The initial attempted filtered `pnpm dlx` invocation was invalid; reran from `apps/mobile` using the same command as CI.
- Final full pinned `pnpm validate`: **188 tests** (23 policy + 165 application in 22 Vitest files), formatting/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 12 web routes pass. Final live `pnpm security:audit` **passes**, reporting **0 high, 0 critical, 6 moderate, 1 low**. This closes the old external audit-timeout gate for this run; lower-severity records are retained in `docs/security/DEPENDENCY_RISK_ACCEPTANCE.md`.
- Native regeneration, signing/install, physical/wireless/camera/UI/performance and coverage were not rerun for this patch set. Do not use the old Xcode 26.6 binary or prior UI screenshots as acceptance of updated native dependencies. Remote results must be read for the final patch commit in GitHub Actions.

## Owner-authorized GitHub synchronization — 2026-09-10

- Fresh fetch: no remote-only changes, 13 local-only commits, clean worktree. Default branch `main`, private `roopeaal/KierratysAppi`; no name/visibility/settings changes. Normal fast-forward push succeeded for `87404a0..dd48a62`; `git ls-remote origin refs/heads/main` exactly matched local implementation HEAD `dd48a626f19dcd9cc53fea597df678159aa9e67a`.
- Full pinned `PATH="$PWD/work/pnpm-check-shims.cqbctz:$PATH" pnpm validate` rerun passed: 20 repository policy + 165 application tests (**185 total**), formatting/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 12-route web export. `git diff --check origin/main..HEAD` passed before the push.
- Changed-path inspection found only `.env.example` among environment/credential-artifact filename patterns. Native projects/builds, local work/screenshots and dependency folders remain ignored. No local Gitleaks executable was available; this path check is not a substitute for GitHub's actual secret scan.
- For implementation HEAD `dd48a62`, [Security](https://github.com/roopeaal/KierratysAppi/actions/runs/34455323825) completed successfully: the Gitleaks secrets job passed; CodeQL was explicitly skipped by the existing private-repository gate, not passed. [CI](https://github.com/roopeaal/KierratysAppi/actions/runs/34455323779) was still running `pnpm validate` after checkout/tool setup/frozen installation passed. The follow-up documentation push starts its own checks; inspect the workflow for the exact final HEAD before claiming remote acceptance. No new live dependency-audit, physical/native-build, legal or store pass is implied.

## KeepItGreen display-name change — 2026-09-10

- Baseline: clean `44ca955`. Changed display/localized names and current brand copy only; application identifiers, provider/sorting behavior, storage keys and dependency graph are unchanged.
- Narrow regressions: `node --test scripts/__tests__/app-brand-policy.test.mjs` **3/3** and `corepack pnpm --filter @kierratysappi/localization test` **4/4** pass. The first test draft used two nonexistent localization keys; corrected to the actual `privacyDraft`/`deleteLocalDataBody` keys, then narrow and strict-type/full runs passed.
- Full `PATH="$PWD/work/pnpm-check-shims.cqbctz:$PATH" pnpm validate` with pinned pnpm 11.16.0: **pass**, 20 Node policy + 165 application tests in 22 Vitest files (**185 total**), formatting/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 12 static web routes. No new dependency or live security-audit pass is claimed.
- Browser reproduction: open local Metro web Home, set 390×844 viewport, inspect FI, select English, inspect again, restore FI and open Privacy and terms. Both Home wordmarks and accessible labels read KeepItGreen without clipping; the Finnish page has no document horizontal overflow. Privacy/deletion copy reads KeepItGreenin and the legal-review marker remains visible. No data-deletion action was triggered. Restore Home/FI and reset viewport after QA.
- Ignored local screenshots: `work/ui-qa/2026-09-10-design/keepitgreen-home-fi-390.png` and `keepitgreen-home-en-390.png`. This is browser evidence, not native launcher/VoiceOver/dark-mode acceptance.
- Export entry `entry-653e028d04f09527ac6625cb6a5be84d.js`: **2,548,479 bytes / 576,724 gzip**. The existing bundle warning remains; no performance improvement is claimed.
- Not run: native regeneration/build/install, signing renewal, cable-disconnected device flow or embedded-JS standalone runtime. The previous phone binary/profile is unchanged. Free/wireless procedure and current official sources: `docs/research/ios-free-wireless-development.md`. Release remains **NO-GO**; name rights/store availability need OA-10 approval.

## Visual refresh — 2026-09-10

- Full pinned `pnpm validate` passes: **181 tests** (17 policy + 164 application), format/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 12 exported web routes. No dependency or native-build change.
- Actual browser evidence covers scoped FI/EN Home/manual/result/guide, 320/390/1280 widths, invalid input, real OFF product resolution, controlled unreachable-API offline → local guide and ambiguous local-component guidance. Source/date/version/verification/confidence and OFF attribution remain present. Explicit web radio checked-state regressions were repaired and inspected.
- Screenshots, exact sizes, reproduction and limits: `design-refresh-evidence.md`. The new UI is **not physically accepted**: September 8 XCTest reopen timed out. Dark/largest native text/camera/VoiceOver/performance remain pending. Prior iPhone screenshots below describe the earlier design.

## Xcode 27 evaluation and restored-app smoke — 2026-09-08

- Source baseline `a6af06c`, clean before documentation changes. Xcode 27 beta 6 (`27A5252f`)/iOS 27 SDK fresh Debug compile passes; recursive app and 11 framework signatures pass; physical installation passes. **Runtime fails** immediately with `SIGTRAP` in UIKit's no-scene-lifecycle enforcement. An initial successful launch/PID return is not a startup pass.
- The generated Expo AppDelegate still owns its window through the old app lifecycle. Apple requires UIScene when linking against iOS 27. Xcode 27 app compilation is therefore rejected for this configuration pending migration; see `XCODE_27_VALIDATION.md` for crash evidence, exact sanitized build procedure and official sources.
- Restored the signed Xcode 26.6/iOS 26.5 artifact over the failing app without deleting app data. Finnish Home → manual known-product lookup → Nutella result, unknown 0%/partial 55% confidence, Rinki/FI/checked-date/version/verification and OFF licence/attribution passed through the beta-built automation runner. Terminate/relaunch returned interactive Home.
- Privacy-safe screenshots: ignored `work/ui-qa/2026-09-08-restored-home-ios.png`, `2026-09-08-restored-result-ios.png`, `2026-09-08-restored-provenance-ios.png`. A capture of an unrelated foreground surface was removed immediately and is not evidence.
- Full pinned `pnpm validate` passes: 13 policy + 154 application tests (167 total), format/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 12 web routes. Logs/artifacts: ignored `work/xcode27-device.2T1Y9A/`. No new dependency/live-security-audit pass is claimed.
- Beta device tooling works; app builds continue with explicit Xcode 26.6. System default remains Command Line Tools. Profile expiration remains **2026-09-11 07:01:05 UTC** and the Debug client still needs Metro/API. Camera, VoiceOver, Release/TestFlight, performance and wider matrix were not tested in this run.

## Physical iPhone current-client smoke — 2026-09-07

- Post-evidence repository validation: full `pnpm validate` passed through the isolated Corepack shim at the repository pin, pnpm 11.16.0. Format, lint and strict type checks passed; 13 repository-policy tests plus 154 application tests passed; all package/API builds and the 12-route web export passed.
- Repository identity before this run: local `main` at `77ad397`, nine commits ahead of `origin/main`; no push or publication was performed.
- Host/device identity: Apple M1 on macOS Tahoe 26.7 (`25G227`), Xcode 26.6 (`17F113`), and a connected iPhone 12 Pro Max on iOS 27.0 (`24A5424a`) as reported by `xcdevice`/XCTest.
- Runtime connectivity: the Mac API and Metro health endpoints passed on localhost and LAN address `192.168.10.43`. The installed Expo 57 development client launched through that Metro origin, and the phone established multiple TCP connections to Metro.
- Home: the Finnish Home interactive semantic tree and screenshot passed on the physical iPhone. Evidence: ignored `work/ui-qa/2026-09-07-home-fi-ios.png`.
- Manual entry: the interactive semantic flow reached the manual product-code form and submitted the known valid product lookup. This is functional semantic evidence, not a VoiceOver reading-order or Dynamic Type pass.
- The first known lookup correctly rendered the offline state because the client had loaded a stale 2026-09-04 Metro bundle containing that day's API address. Metro was safely restarted with the current `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`, the client was relaunched, and the same manual flow then resolved normally.
- Answer-first result: the current client preserved one unknown material at **0%** rather than guessing, and showed plastic collection at **55% partial confidence**. Evidence: ignored `work/ui-qa/2026-09-07-known-product-result-top-fi-ios.png`.
- Provenance/result continuation: the lower page showed Rinki source, FI jurisdiction, checked date **2026-08-10**, rule version and verified status, plus Nutella identity. Evidence: ignored `work/ui-qa/2026-09-07-known-product-provenance-fi-ios.png`.
- Scope: this run does **not** pass camera scanning, VoiceOver, release configuration, performance, battery, dark mode, reduced motion, broader barcode cases or other physical-device lanes.

## Historical final rebuild and initial connection failure — 2026-09-04

- Host: macOS Tahoe 26.7 (`25G220`), Xcode 26.6 (`17F113`), local Node 26.4.0. The owner freed disk space; no user data cleanup was performed by Codex.
- Final frozen install, peer check, Expo install check and Doctor 1.20.1 **20/20** pass with the strict release-age policy intact. Expo 57.0.19 / RN 0.86.3 / dev-client 57.0.18 are installed. Isolated Corepack shims under ignored `work/pnpm-check-shims.cqbctz` verified nested pnpm **11.16.0**, avoiding the host's different global pnpm.
- Final `corepack pnpm validate`: **pass, 167 tests** (154 Vitest tests in 22 files plus 13 Node policy tests), formatting, lint, strict types, package/API builds and 12 web routes. Narrow API 12/12 and database 5/5 pass. Earlier concurrent runs exceeded the unchanged 5-second database test timeout while Xcode was compiling; the narrow and complete reruns passed after compilation without relaxing the test.
- Final coverage: **pass**, all 154 application tests. Core statement coverage is unchanged from the table below; mobile is 70.75% statements / 79.51% branches / 57.14% functions / 73.40% lines. SQL migration execution is tested; the JS coverage tool's 0/0 database output is not SQL coverage.
- Final bundle: entry **2,540,918 bytes / 575,233 gzip**; secondary **45,171 / 14,789 gzip**. No device performance claim follows from these sizes.
- Security: fast-uri 3.1.5/4.1.2 upgraded within their allowed major ranges to **3.1.7/4.1.4**. The post-update raw snapshot reports **0 high, 0 critical, 6 moderate, 1 low**. The final live `security:audit` retry **fails closed at 60 seconds**: the official audit POST endpoint also times out independently, while registry metadata GET returns 200. The live gate is externally blocked, not passed. No high/critical exceptions remain; five added regressions cover floors, severity enforcement and valid/invalid report handling.
- Native: live-workspace `expo prebuild --platform ios --no-install` regenerated ignored native files; incidental package-script changes were reverted. `pod install` completed with 111 pods; manifest/lock and JS/native versions agree. Fresh Xcode Debug `iphoneos` build **passes**, recursive app signature and **11/11 framework signatures pass**. Artifact: `work/ios-dev-client-2026-09-04-derived/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/KierrtysAppi.app`; ignored build log is alongside it. Profile expiration: **2026-09-11 07:01:05 UTC**.
- At the time of this 2026-09-04 run, physical install and development-launcher opening **passed**, but the explicit Metro origin showed `Error loading app` / connection refused, so Home/manual/result were not then reverified. Actual historical failure screenshot: `work/ui-qa/2026-09-04-ios-dev-client-connection-error.png`; no camera frame was captured. The later 2026-09-07 section above records the successful current-client connection and smoke.
- On 2026-09-04, API `/v1/health` and Metro `/status` responded correctly on localhost and that day's Mac LAN address, both bound all interfaces, and the macOS firewall permitted the actual Node executable with block-all disabled. No network/firewall setting was changed. The connectivity blocker documented that day was resolved for the 2026-09-07 current-client smoke.

## Earlier startup-only attempt — 2026-09-04

- `corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`: pass with pnpm 11.16.0 after the interrupted eight-package Expo patch update. This is not full update acceptance.
- Local API `GET /v1/health`: pass, `{"status":"ok","version":"0.1.0"}`. Metro `GET /status`: pass, `packager-status:running`. Services were left running.
- Physical launch: **fail**, iOS refused the existing app with a signing/entitlement/trust security error. Extraction of only `ExpirationDate` from the last installed artifact's provisioning profile showed `2026-08-29T13:03:31Z`; `codesign --verify --deep --strict` still passed local artifact integrity. No device identifier, account identifier or signing secret is recorded here.
- Native compatibility remains unverified: installed fixture Expo 57.0.16 / RN 0.86.2 versus current JS Expo 57.0.18 / RN 0.86.3. About 2.3 GiB free disk space was observed; no new native build/install, physical Home pass or complete test suite was run in this startup-only request. No commit was made.

The remainder records the historical 2026-08-28 validation baseline, not a current pass for the updated dependencies.

Evidence date: 2026-08-28. Host: macOS and local Node 26.4.0. The host-global pnpm is 11.19.0, while all final validation commands used `corepack pnpm` at the project pin 11.16.0; production/CI/EAS Node remains pinned to 24.19.0.

## Physical iOS preflight — historical 2026-08-28 baseline

| Command/evidence | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `sw_vers` / host inspection | Apple M1 on macOS 26.5.2 (`25F84`), compatible with current Xcode 26.6 |
| `xcode-select -p` | System selection remains `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`; all native commands explicitly set `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` |
| `xcodebuild -version` | Pass: Xcode 26.6 (`17F113`), iOS 26.5 SDK |
| `xcrun devicectl list devices` | Pass: paired, connected iPhone 12 Pro Max running iOS 26.1; device identifiers are intentionally omitted |
| `pnpm --filter @kierratysappi/mobile exec expo config --type public` | Pass: evaluated bundle/version, permission, locale, privacy and plugin configuration |
| Clean iOS prebuild in ignored `work/` | Pass: native project generated without installing pods |
| Generated deployment/bundle | iOS 16.4; `fi.roopeaaltonen.kierratysappi`; version `0.1.0`, build `1` |
| Generated purpose strings | Finnish/English camera-only text; no microphone or location usage string |
| Generated privacy/entitlements | Empty app entitlements; no tracking/collected types; UserDefaults reason `CA92.1` |
| Debug native compile | Pass on 2026-08-22 and 2026-08-26 for generic `iphoneos`; a fresh 2026-08-28 build also contains `expo-dev-client`/dev-launcher/dev-menu 57.0.16. Dependency build-script warnings were emitted, no build error |
| Recursive signature | Pass: 11/11 embedded frameworks valid; `codesign --verify --deep --strict` passed for the app |
| Physical install/runtime matrix | Partial pass: development installs cover lifecycle, EAN-13, permissions, known/unknown/OFF/offline/retry/cache/provenance and controlled backend-unavailable recovery. The rebuilt development client launches without the earlier null script URL and physically rendered the redesigned Home/manual/answer-first result; see `docs/final/PHYSICAL_IOS_VALIDATION.md` |

Official Expo and Apple requirements were rechecked on 2026-08-28. Expo's current development-build guidance requires an SDK-compatible `expo-dev-client` for the launcher/tooling expected by this profile and requires a rebuild after native dependency changes. Apple requires Xcode 26/iOS 26 SDK uploads and permits local Personal-Team testing with seven-day provisioning limits. The observed profile did expire after seven days; a renewed build/install on 2026-08-22 restored the development run. This is not release/TestFlight evidence.

## Passing evidence — historical 2026-08-28 baseline

## Coverage evidence — historical 2026-08-28 baseline

Coverage is useful but not a release gate substitute. V8 summaries:

| Package | Statements | Branches | Functions | Lines |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Domain | 91.12% | 84.41% | 94.44% | 90.90% |
| Data providers | 94.07% | 90.82% | 95.83% | 95.07% |
| Recycling engine | 92.42% | 77.55% | 100% | 91.93% |
| Application | 90.54% | 83.33% | 100% | 92.95% |
| API | 95.58% | 91.48% | 93.33% | 97.01% |
| Mobile tested modules | 70.75% | 79.51% | 57.14% | 73.40% |
| Localization | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| Database SQL | Not meaningfully represented by V8 | PGlite behavior tests are the evidence |

Mobile coverage excludes most rendered route/component code; it must not be interpreted as native UI acceptance.

## Live and visual evidence — historical through 2026-08-28

- Real GTIN `3017620422003` resolved through local API → OFF to Nutella with four packaging components. Missing cap material remained unknown. Source, community status, combined ODbL/DbCL, attribution and retrieval date were visible.
- A controlled provider-unavailable fixture produced `Tietolähde ei vastaa` without classifying the product as unknown. After restoring the real API, the same Retry action recovered to Nutella without code re-entry; the API observation remained free of raw GTIN.
- Manual invalid GTIN produced a visible web alert. On physical iOS, VoiceOver exposed two defects: the placeholder became the field name and the alert was silent/interrupted. Explicit localized text-input labels and a high-priority iOS announcement path were added; VoiceOver then announced the correct EAN/GTIN field name/hint/trait and read the full validation instruction automatically.
- A later known-product run rendered Nutella but VoiceOver stayed on `Hae tuote`. The result screen now maps and announces loading plus every terminal lookup state. Six state expectations and repository policy pass; physical confirmation of this repair is deferred while functional and visual testing takes priority.
- Redesigned Home, manual, resolved result, ambiguous result and offline recovery were inspected at 390×844 in Finnish; Home and result also passed English wrapping. Home/result at 1280×720 each measured zero horizontally overflowing DOM elements. Close/internal actions exposed button semantics, external rule/licence/provider sources remained links, and document language followed the UI language.
- Physical iPhone semantic inspection and 1284×2778 screenshots passed the redesigned Finnish Home, manual lookup and answer-first Nutella result. Scanner exposed localized Close and torch buttons; no live-camera screenshot was captured. The development automation toolbar overlaps the torch's top-right hit target, so the actual physical toggle is not claimed.
- Legal showed confirmed all-local-data deletion.
- Web browser state was restored and audit tabs finalized after inspection.
- On the physical iPhone, the same known GTIN resolved through OFF in earlier 343 ms evidence and in the updated UI run; current privacy-safe local observations included a 249 ms live lookup and 5 ms cache hit. The result placed destination/preparation/explanation before product metadata while retaining source/licence/attribution and full rule evidence.
- A physical EAN-13 package decoded and produced a single safe `not_found` result; the privacy-safe server observation completed in 162 ms without raw-GTIN logging.
- Airplane mode produced the offline screen with no API request. Restoring network and retrying recovered without re-entry and returned a cache hit in 8 ms.
- Camera pre-permission explanation, allow, permission revocation while backgrounded, denied recovery UI, deep-link to app settings and permission restoration all worked on-device. Initial system-prompt denial remains unrun.
- Manual `123` produced `Tarkista koodi`, generated no API request and, after repair, announced the complete validation instruction through VoiceOver without requiring focus on the error.

## Bundle/performance evidence — historical 2026-08-28 baseline

- Expo export: 12 static routes.
- Main web entry: 2,539,834 bytes uncompressed; 575,888 bytes gzip. This is 10,242 bytes / 3,604 gzip larger than the prior baseline and remains above budget.
- Secondary web chunk: 45,171 bytes uncompressed; 14,831 bytes gzip.
- The entry exceeds the documented 2 MiB warning threshold. An `agent-device perf frames` attempt returned no matched app process and zero captured frames, so it is invalid evidence; no native startup, memory, frame pacing, camera latency or battery claim is made.

## Compatibility evidence — historical 2026-08-28 baseline

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Explicit supply-chain age policy | `minimumReleaseAge: 1440` and strict enforcement in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; lockfile verification passes |
| `expo install --check` | **Fail as of 2026-08-28:** eight supported patch mismatches. The newest required Expo/constants/font patches are blocked by the strict age gate until 2026-08-29 10:49 UTC; no exclusion/bypass was used |
| Expo Doctor 1.20.1 | **19/20** for the same eight patch mismatches; the other 19 checks pass |
| `corepack pnpm peers check` | Pass: no peer dependency issues |

## Unavailable mandatory evidence

| Check | Actual result | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Android compile/sign/install | Unavailable: no Java runtime, Android SDK/ADB/EAS credentials | External blocker |
| iOS release archive/TestFlight | Development compile/sign/install passes, but no paid-program archive, TestFlight processing or release-configuration install exists | External account/signing/store blocker |
| Physical barcode matrix | Partial: one EAN-13 and permission/recovery paths pass; EAN-8, UPC-A, UPC-E rejection, glare/distance/damage/multiple/rapid cases remain | Physical/manual blocker |
| VoiceOver/TalkBack/large text | Partial iPhone VoiceOver pass: home/scanner/manual-invalid subset; async result repair passes locally but awaits device retest; TalkBack, largest text and remaining recovery flows are unrun | Physical/manual blocker; broader accessibility follows functional/visual work, Android is unavailable |
| Production API/database/monitoring | Does not exist | External infrastructure blocker |
| Backup/restore/load/failover | Not run | External infrastructure blocker |
| Store console/binary validation | Not run | External account/signing blocker |
| Audit-commit remote CI | September 10 `dd48a62` Gitleaks job passes, CodeQL skips; CI is running and final workflow outcome must be checked for the exact HEAD | Remote validation pending, not blocked by missing push authorization |

No unavailable test is recorded as passed by simulation or documentation.
