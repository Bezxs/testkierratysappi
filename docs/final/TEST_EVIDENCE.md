# Test evidence

2026-10-30 Overview prototype in `Bezxs/testkierratysappi`, based on `aaa3720`:

- The feature is mobile/localization only, with unchanged dependencies, backend and shared rules/contracts. No original-repository change, real provider/photo/GPS request or paid inference.
- New persistence/model tests cover concurrent writes, duplicate intent IDs, failed acknowledgements, errors/corruption/version validation, deletion coordination, paper/carton separation, rounded 100% totals and lifetime counts after the recent 100 records roll out. Initial targeted mobile run passed 45 cases.
- Full `pnpm validate` passes 471 unique tests (113 policy + 358 application), boundaries, formatting, lint, strict types, package/API builds and 17 exported web routes. `pnpm validate:mobile` passes 282 overlapping tests and its build. First full lint found extra hook dependencies in the new recording action; retry/focus handling was corrected without suppression, then both validations passed.
- Cross-platform inline confirmations cover recording, removal/reset and Privacy deletion. The existing all-local-data control includes the new app-prefixed key and shares the storage lock. Read-only review prompted fixes for focus-change save cleanup, provider label controls and feedback showing the material actually saved when a photo selection is later corrected. Backend/shared/configuration/lockfile/dependencies remain unchanged.
- The new `scripts/qa/overview-browser.cjs` passes full FI/EN flows: lookup and unconfirmed/unknown parts do not record, mark/cancel/confirm, retained-intent duplicate prevention, another lookup of the same product, reload/new-page persistence, manual quantities/material percentages including separate paper/carton, failed-write retry, record removal, reset, history isolation, corrupt-data preservation and app-wide deletion with foreign-key preservation. Corrected AI plastic-to-glass recording and saved-material correction feedback pass with synthetic camera/API fixtures only. Light/dark, 320/390/1280 widths, 130% synthetic text, 44-point controls and screenshots were checked. First attempts exposed an invalid QA fixture, Fast Refresh context disruption during source edits, then cold Metro compilation timeout; the corrected, unchanged app source passes after a clean warm server restart.
- Existing regression runners: reference Home, nearby UX and photo recognition pass unchanged on their first attempts. The app-refinement and integrated-navigation runners retain the same immediate Home-visibility/tab-count failures observed on baseline `aaa3720`; neither runner was changed or retried to hide them. The new Overview runner passes its full stable-render, storage, product and photo checks.
- iOS and Android Hermes JavaScript exports pass under ignored `work/overview-native/`; these are bundler checks, not native compilation, signing, installation or physical acceptance. Fresh security policy and peer checks pass with unchanged dependency versions: zero high/critical, twelve moderate and six low advisory records remain.
- Evidence/logs are `/workspace/outputs/overview-v2/`; screenshots and isolated fixtures remain ignored under `work/overview-qa/`. Browser and JavaScript-export checks do not certify physical-device persistence/VoiceOver/camera acceptance. The original main remains outside this prototype's publication scope.

## October29 — fresh contributor recheck and owner-authorized main sharing

- **Publication receipt:** coherent heading/recheck commit091d962389a56ec5c52386cfbaf4a8bddef6b013 follows the seven reviewed integration/maintenance commits. Documentation-inclusive final full validation also passes431 cases (`validate-final.log`). Immediate fresh fetch still has0 remote-only/8 local-only; working tree clean and actual destination/ref verified. Normal explicit `git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/main` succeeds **28e0f32..091d962**. Independent `git ls-remote --heads origin main` at2026-10-29T20:41:13Z equals the exact local SHA. No force, private KeepItGreen write, tag/other branch/settings or production release.
- Actual GitHub runs for that source SHA: [CI40951228125](https://github.com/roopeaal/KierratysAppi/actions/runs/40951228125) and [Security40951228098](https://github.com/roopeaal/KierratysAppi/actions/runs/40951228098) initially **in progress**. These are new runs, not the older main's failed CI; no remote pass inferred. This source-only publication/outcome follow-up is within the same explicit owner authorization; future team sharing still needs a new request.
- Actual origin is `https://github.com/roopeaal/KierratysAppi.git`; private
  KeepItGreen remote/default push target is not used. Fresh fetch, independent
  ls-remote heads and paginated GitHub main-author/PR metadata still confirm
  main28e0f32, ITbes-dev1 commit, Rdotcom8 plus merged#37. All ten IDs remain
  ancestors at efbf28b (0 behind/7 ahead). Two independent source/patch reviews
  find no new contributor behavior loss or private-history merge. Native-only
  address lookup and still-unwired material helper remain explicit pre-existing
  limits; see CONTRIBUTOR_PRESERVATION_AUDIT for current vs dated baseline.
- Rename only Home's four existing editorial-shortcut heading to **Suositut
  haut / Popular searches**; no measured ranking/tracking/provider change.
  New localized regression:8/8 localization cases pass. Full pinned
  `pnpm validate` passes **431 unique cases (113 policy + 318 application)**,
  boundaries/format/lint/types/all builds/16 routes. Mobile scope passes
  **242 overlapping cases**. Independent contributor-focused24 mobile,
  13 collection-contract and10 location-policy cases also pass; not new totals.
- Fresh online Expo install check passes; pinned Doctor1.21.5 **20/20**;
  unchanged live security policy passes with **0 high/critical**, twelve
  moderate/six low records retained. No dependency update, exception or CI
  gate bypass in this heading/sharing unit. Auto-install before diagnostic
  commands is disabled; mandatory validation commands are unchanged.
- Actual-Metro reference Home suite passes in FI/EN: new semantic heading,
  four real shortcuts/local search/recovery, opt-out history protection and
  explicit reopen, combined Identify entry, no implicit API/GPS and44pt targets.
  Inspect FI/EN390px screenshots: heading fits and actions remain readable.
  Strict integrated suite passes barcode/manual/AI entry/back, selected tabs,
  direct-URL noGPS vs one-shot Points press/five sourced records, FI/EN/dark/
  320/390/1280 and130% synthetic text. No actual barcode/photo/location/provider
  or paid call. Earlier five-suite evidence remains separately dated above/below;
  this unit reruns these two affected navigation/Home suites, not all five.
- First new heading assertion fails because the long-running test Metro
  serves **Selaa materiaaleja**; DOM diagnostic confirms stale text. Restart
  only verified loopback8094 with cleared cache; unchanged heading assertion
  passes. First concurrent cold integration sequence times out at direct
  `/nearby`; isolated diagnostic returns200/no page errors/noGPS, and the same
  complete strict suite passes alone after builds finish. No app workaround,
  assertion loosening, added retries or hidden failure. Phone services untouched.
- Aggregate selected history/path review finds no work/native/profile/key/
  device artifacts or source deletions. Limited redacted-pattern scan across
  all seven pending patches finds zero candidates, not full Gitleaks acceptance.
  Roope explicitly authorizes the normal team-main source push; actual remote
  SHA and GitHub CI outcomes are recorded after execution, not inferred here.
  Public production remains NO-GO; no new external blocker or native/paid action.
- Ignored receipts/screenshots: `work/team-push-2026-10-29.92TZOw/` contains
  validate.log, validate-mobile.log, security-audit.log, expo-check.log,
  expo-doctor.log, failed reference-home.log/integration.log, passing
  reference-home-repaired.log/integration-recheck.log, local DOM diagnostics,
  metro-8094.log, reference-home/ and integration/ fixture PNGs. No private
  user/device data, credential values, signed app or generated native files in Git.

## October29 — patched iPhone build4 installed and started

- Source baseline `e815522`; only iOS build4 metadata plus corresponding policy
  and one immutable-native-Constants guard regression. Initial added fixture
  failed strict TS2353; repaired with a structural variable, no suppression.
  Full validation passes **430 unique tests (113 policy+317 application)**,
  all builds/16 routes; mobile typecheck,12 photo cases/4 policy cases pass.
  Final documentation-inclusive rerun also passes: mobile241 overlapping cases
  (`validate-mobile.log`) and full430 (`validate-final.log`) in the same root.
- Completed verified app3/entire-native-tree APFS snapshots before Expo cleared
  the ignored iOS directory. New generation and CocoaPods1.17 install122 pods;
  new lock equals Manifest. React-Core0.88.1 and all twelve Expo/RN patch targets
  match JS. No old-lock restoration, cleanup, new runtime dependency or ID change.
- Stable Xcode26.6/iOS26.5 Debug serial **BUILD SUCCEEDED**. Explicit new verifier
  checks actual build4/config4/0.1.0/ID/name/scheme, default/FI/EN camera/location,
  no microphone/Always/background location, strict app/all11-framework signatures,
  profile/signed team/app/device/task-allow binding and patched native lock.
  Reused valid profile: **created2026-10-28T18:28:39Z; expires2026-11-04T18:28:39Z /
  November4 at20:28:39 Helsinki**. No new seven-day renewal is claimed.
- Replacement install succeeds. Exact-bundle device inventory confirms0.1.0/
  build4, without uninstall/reset. No private app data/history inspected; data
  retention is not independently certified. Current iOS manifest/actual launch
  asset are200/build4/SDK58,12,156,274 bytes, current LAN API and no server-key
  markers. These are host checks, separate from physical observations below.
- Native launch succeeds without a new trust prompt; three targeted queries
  retain its PID. Actual in-scope Home and passive `/identify` deep-link images
  inspected: current artwork/combined card/four tabs and barcode/manual/AI order
  with uncertainty text. Return-home link succeeds. Not a physical button/back,
  largest-text/VoiceOver/camera/GPS/recognition-accuracy/all-flow pass.
- Initial all-interface API start was blocked before execution. Roope explicitly
  approves current trusted LAN and current key. API binds only that address3003;
  Metro127.0.0.1:8093 plus address-only forwarding8093, no payload logging.
  Services run only after matching client4 install; no wildcard listener. Existing
  key stays server-side/unchanged, not printed or in the bundle. Only health/
  capability GETs, no image, actual location/barcode, provider or paid inference.
- Ignored root `work/ios-patch-2026-10-29.jsZhvk/`: original-clone/profile receipt,
  client3.app/ios-client3, prebuild/pods/build, first validate.log and repaired
  validate-repaired.log; native-verification.json, install.json, installed-after.json,
  dev-runtime-verification.json, launch.json, process-{1,2,3}.json, native-home.png,
  native-identify.png, return-home.json. Main app hash/lock hash in verifier receipt.
  Source-only documentation: IOS_PATCH_CLIENT4; no profiles/identifiers/binaries/
  screenshots in Git, no GitHub push or production GO.

## October 29 — SDK 58 compatibility/security repair

- Owner-approved maintenance from `ceedb6a`. Frozen install/supply-chain age
  verification, peers and fresh online Expo check pass. CI-pinned **Doctor
  1.21.5: 20/20**. Live unchanged security policy passes: **zero high/critical,
  12 moderate + 6 low** retained. Raw audit exits1 for monitored records, not a
  policy failure. No exception/exclusion or severity downgrade.
- Full validation passes **429 unique cases (113 policy + 316 application)**,
  boundaries/format/lint/types/all builds/16 routes. All three independent
  scopes pass; overlapping tests, not additional totals. Nineteen new SDK/
  security-floor/parser/actual Expo CLI-Zod regressions complement existing v1/
  API/provider tests. Independent focused29/29 overlaps the full count.
  Final documentation-inclusive full rerun also passes: `validate-final.log`.
- **All five actual-Metro browser suites pass** on isolated loopback8094:
  navigation, reference Home, whole-app refinement, photo safety and nearby.
  Synthetic camera/GPS and intercepted product/photo responses only; no real
  user data, paid inference or live provider lookup. Existing FI/EN, all-method
  entry/back, passive entry, consent/material correction/provenance, recovery,
  local state, keyboard, dark, 320/390/1280 and130% synthetic-text checks remain.
  Inspected Home, dark Identify and narrow/large material-review screenshots.
- Initial navigation failure was a mixed-frame responsive measurement race:
  stale manual y405/h137 against AI y528; atomic measurement gave actual
  manual bottom512/AI top528, a16px gap. Wait for the scoped narrow branch and
  read all geometry/fonts together; exact assertions remain. First repair's
  broad icon selector was corrected to current Identify actions. Original
  failure/diagnostic retained, not treated as app overlap or ignored.
- Built API smoke with photo AI explicitly disabled: health/OpenAPI/
  capabilities HTTP200, synthetic malformed lookup HTTP400. Corrected first
  smoke's wrong OpenAPI URL to unchanged `/v1/openapi.json`. No valid lookup.
  App source/localization/assets/rules/directory/SQL/identity/model/prompt/CI/
  audit implementation unchanged; intentional package/lock/CLI migration explicit.
- Ignored root: `work/sdk58-security-maintenance-2026-10-29/`. Core logs:
  `frozen-install`, `peers`, `expo-check`, `expo-doctor`, `security-audit`,
  `validate`, `validate-{shared,backend,mobile}`, `api-smoke` (`.log`);
  `audit-{before,after}.json`. Browser: `navigation-final.log`, `reference.log`,
  `refinement.log`, `photo.log`, `nearby.log`, `browser/`; initial failure is
  `navigation.log`. SDK58_SECURITY_MAINTENANCE records procedures/failed attempts.
- **Not a phone/native/signing/install or remote CI pass.** Verified old
  Metro8093/API3003 paused before native-dependency changes; matching client
  rebuild/install/smoke is next. Old November4 profile not renewed. No GitHub
  write/paid call; production NO-GO and PHOTO-003 remain.

## October 29 — contributor preservation / pre-sharing audit

- Inspected app `ceedb6a`, fresh team main `28e0f32`; 0 remote-only/5
  local-only commits. GitHub account queries verify ITbes-dev's one commit and
  Rdotcom's eight nonmerge commits plus merged PR #37. All are ancestors;
  actual patches/call sites and unchanged core files were also checked.
  Matrix and qualifications: CONTRIBUTOR_PRESERVATION_AUDIT.
- Fresh pinned full validation **410 unique cases (94 policy + 316 app)**,
  all gates/builds/16 routes passes. Independent mobile 148/contracts 25/
  location-policy 10/SDK-policy 10 checks also pass; overlapping, not additive.
- Fresh **online Expo install --check exits 1: 12 expected patch updates**.
  Earlier offline-map fallback is not accepted. Fresh **security:audit exits
  1: 12 high/critical advisory records**, no exceptions. Current-main lockfile/
  manifest/workflows are unchanged; findings are not visual-branch additions.
- Actual main CI 40403403764 failed Dependency security policy on October 26;
  its three part jobs and separate Security 40403403577 succeeded. Do not
  equate these different workflows or infer an active secret leak from an older
  annotation. GET metadata only, no workflow rerun.
- Ignored logs: `work/contributor-audit-2026-10-29/{validate,security-audit}.log`.
  Final documentation-inclusive full rerun also passes in
  `validate-post-audit-docs.log`; app HEAD remains `ceedb6a`.
  pnpm 11.16.0 with automatic pre-command dependency installation disabled to
  keep review non-mutating; actual mandatory checks were not weakened.
  No new browser/native/accuracy pass, real user data, paid call, app/package
  correction, merge, commit, push or PR. Only audit/state documentation updated.

## October 29 — combined barcode/manual/AI hub

- Full pinned `pnpm validate`: **410 unique cases (94 policy + 316 application)**,
  all mandatory gates/builds and 16 routes; scoped mobile **240 overlapping
  cases**. Logs: `work/identify-hub-2026-10-29/validate-final.log` and
  `validate-mobile.log`. Standalone mobile typecheck/7 localization cases also pass.
- Five source-policy regressions plus expanded actual browser assertions verify
  Home gateway→selected Identify tab, barcode/manual/AI reading/keyboard/visual
  order, larger barcode action, each entry/back path, passive hub and FI/EN
  names/AI uncertainty. Narrow/native-large layout prioritizes text over
  secondary icon columns; final 320-pixel browser labels retain usable width.
- All five actual-Metro suites pass final source: `navigation.log`,
  `reference.log`, `refinement.log`, `photo.log`, `nearby.log` in the same
  ignored root; first visual pass preserved separately. FI/EN/light/dark,
  320/390/1280 and 130% synthetic text, current source/error/local-state/photo/
  nearby safeguards remain. Exact snapshot locations in IDENTIFY_HUB_EVIDENCE.
- No real image/barcode/location/address or paid inference, backend/shared/model/
  rule/dependency/native/signing/install change or GitHub write. Latest physical
  hub/navigation/large-text/VoiceOver/camera/accuracy remain unverified; earlier
  phone Home evidence is not generalized. November 4 expiry and production NO-GO
  gates remain unchanged.

## October 29 — Home-aligned functional pages

- Final pinned `pnpm validate` passes **405 unique cases (89 policy + 316
  application)**, all mandatory boundaries/format/lint/strict types/builds and
  **16 web routes**; final scoped mobile passes **240 overlapping cases**.
  Logs: `work/app-design-consistency-2026-10-29/validate-complete.log` and
  `validate-mobile-final.log`.
- Nine new source-policy regressions guard shared font/mono distinction,
  derived Home palette, thirteen functional pages, leaf/back/icon semantics,
  retained warnings/consent, separated keyboard focus and dark root surface.
  Expanded actual browser checks compare Home/subpage computed fonts/heading
  colors/canvas, guide/feedback sans fields, focus ring and navigation background.
- All five runners pass on the current styles: `refinement-verified.log`,
  `reference-accepted.log`, `navigation-accepted.log`, `photo-accepted.log`,
  `nearby-accepted.log` in that root. FI/EN, dark, 130% synthetic text and
  reading/form/Identify/Settings/Nearby 320/390/1280 layouts; existing recovery,
  provenance, local history/drafts/deletion, consent/material correction and
  explicit location boundaries remain. No real GPS/image/address or paid call.
- Latest whole-app snapshots are in `accepted/refinement/`; original runner
  snapshot locations and scope are recorded in APP_DESIGN_CONSISTENCY.
  Independent review found white corners behind rounded dark navigation; root
  theme paint and source/computed-style regressions repair this. Initial
  formatting/import-order errors were fixed, not bypassed.
- One concurrent browser attempt timed out waiting for manual input after the
  offline scenario (`refinement-final-pass.log` retained). Added bounded
  route/readiness/heading/page-error diagnostics and a failure screenshot, with
  no automatic retry, timeout relaxation or skipped assertion; reran separately
  after builds/other browser jobs. Exact cause is not established and no
  flake-free-CI claim is made. Existing two source-literal lint warnings remain.
- No new native build/sign/install, current full-app phone/Dynamic Type/
  VoiceOver/camera/accuracy/performance or production acceptance. Earlier native
  Home evidence is not generalized. November 4 profile expiry and NO-GO gates
  remain unchanged; no dependency/model/rule/backend/shared change or GitHub write.

## October 29 — reference-fidelity and existing-client Home

- Full pinned `pnpm validate`: **396 unique cases (80 policy + 316 application)**,
  all boundaries/format/lint/strict types/builds/16 routes; mobile **240 overlapping
  cases**. Final exits 0: `work/reference-polish-2026-10-29/validate-final.log`
  and `validate-mobile-final.log`.
- Four new built-in-only asset/PNG/topology/wiring cases, eight AA token-pair
  cases and two bounded responsive-crop cases. Original SVGs/native alpha PNGs
  are source-controlled, no new app dependency; same sharp 0.35.5/libvips 8.18.7
  byte re-render `--check` passes (`symbols-check.log`).
- All five actual-Metro runners pass: `browser-final.log`,
  `refinement-final.log`, `navigation.log`, `nearby.log`, `photo.log`.
  New Home AI card routes to the unchanged photo flow. All existing opt-in
  history/local search/explicit GPS and photo consent/material correction/
  unknown/unsafe/cancellation/source evidence remains. Fixtures are isolated;
  no actual image/GPS/address or paid app-recognition request.
- Final FI/EN/Home/large/narrow/dark snapshots reviewed, plus actual latest native
  Home: fresh exact-app activation succeeds, targeted inventory reports 0.1.0/
  build 3, later query finds the launch PID, and the screenshot shows current
  artwork/card/symbols/tabs. No private history entry or other app content shown;
  development gear and OS status/back label are not app-store visuals.
- Native lock/launch/capture/app/process receipts and `native-home.png` remain
  ignored in the same evidence root. No new sign/install/profile/credential or
  native camera/navigation/large-text/VoiceOver/accuracy/standalone claim.
  Existing November 4 profile expiry and production NO-GO remain unchanged.
- Repaired actual initial failures: unsupported weight 750, missing source SVG
  titles and stale source-policy geometry/icon assumptions; did not skip lint,
  add exclusions or weaken failure-mode checks. Reference comparison, source/
  export methodology, exact limits and artifact paths: REFERENCE_VISUAL_POLISH.

## October 28 — closer supplied-reference Home

- Full pinned `pnpm validate`: **382 unique cases (76 repository policy + 306
  application)**; boundaries/format/lint/strict types, package/API builds and
  **16 web routes**. Mobile scope: **230 overlapping cases**. Final exit receipts:
  `work/reference-home-2026-10-28/validate-final.log` and
  `validate-mobile-final.log`.
- Eight new pure cases (5 guide-search, 3 history-preview), two new source-policy
  cases. Existing source policies retain accessible labels, current actions,
  scaling/focus/provenance/no-placeholder/no-implicit-GPS/photo boundaries.
- Five actual-Metro browser runners pass on the final source: new
  `reference-home-browser.cjs`, existing app-refinement, integrated navigation,
  nearby and photo suites. Ignored logs: `browser-final.log`,
  `refinement-final.log`, `navigation-final.log`, `nearby-final.log`,
  `photo-final.log` in the same evidence root.
- New browser cases cover FI/EN local guide search, four material chips,
  unknown/reset/duplicate parameters, opted-out stale-history suppression, a
  real-shaped opt-in saved preview, explicit single re-query and no inferred bin,
  no implicit GPS/provider calls and 44-point controls. Saved values are isolated
  QA fixtures, not user history or runtime seed data.
- Reviewed Home top/footer/history/search, dark, 320/390/1280 and 130% synthetic
  text screenshots. The old large-text word split is reproduced and repaired by
  allocating more text space, without font caps. Native large-text arrow/chip/
  stale-refresh risks found in independent review are repaired and source-guarded.
- Earlier obsolete-ID/prior-route-heading/duplicate-icon/renderer-wait failures
  were repaired before final passes; initial failed logs remain where available.
  One test-only duplicate variable declaration was fixed before final validation.
  First browser launch without host permission failed before page load; reruns
  used approved host access. These facts are not native product failures or a
  claim of flake-free CI.
- Transparent decorative bottle PNG: alpha/dimensions/byte count/hash checked,
  exact built-in tool prompt/input roles/project asset in
  `REFERENCE_HOME_REFINEMENT.md`. Original assets unchanged.
- No real capture/GPS/address or paid app-recognition call. Host Metro/API health
  and `photo-capabilities.enabled=true` pass; no new native build/install/
  signature/accuracy/VoiceOver/standalone claim. Existing release/security/photo
  gates and build-3 November 4 expiry remain. No GitHub push.


## October 28 illustrated integration

Team `28e0f32` functionality/SDK 58 is retained while explicitly approved selected
KeepItGreen `0142bb0` presentation is ported on a separate local branch. New
Home/Identify/Settings/tab routing, one-shot location intent and immersive-flow
separation have four pure + four policy regressions. Full pinned validation
passes **372 unique tests (74 policy + 298 application)** and all mandatory
checks/builds/16 web routes; mobile scope passes **222 overlapping tests**. Four
actual-UI browser runners pass; inspected FI/EN/dark/narrow/large images, synthetic
GPS and photo fixtures remain distinct from native acceptance. No live paid
request or private photo/location acquired. Detailed repairs, artifact paths,
exact owner-approved two-root storage cleanup and native build outcome:
`ILLUSTRATED_INTEGRATION.md`. The serial stable-Xcode native build, strict app/11
framework signatures/profile/device/purpose checks, replacement install/build-3
inventory pass. Actual expiry is **November 4 at 20:28:39 Helsinki**. First FBS
Security refusal resolves after owner **luotettu**: fresh launch, two same-PID
queries and inspected native Home/artwork/four tabs pass. Other native controls,
camera/GPS/retention/a11y/performance remain unaccepted. A fresh 11-package Expo
patch expectation fails closed. No remote write, dependency/security bypass or
production GO; current Debug still needs the Mac Metro/API/LAN.

2026-10-26 SDK 58 migration, tested in `Bezxs/testkierratysappi` at `b578137` and applied locally to KierratysAppi main `73fed83` after the owner confirmed Expo Go works:

- Expo 58.0.19 with React 19.3.0, React Native 0.88.0 and Expo-aligned modules installed through `expo install --fix`; frozen reinstall, `expo install --check` and `pnpm peers check` pass. The one-day release-age gate, signatures/checksums and TLS checks remain enabled. Expo added its status-bar config plugin; app IDs, permissions and application logic are unchanged.
- Full `pnpm validate` passes: 70 policy + 294 application tests, boundaries, formatting, lint, strict types, package/API builds and 14-route web export. `pnpm validate:mobile` also passes. Doctor 1.21.5 passes 20/20; this cloud machine required Node's supported `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1` setting for its proxy. The initial unproxied 18/20 result was a connectivity failure, not a skipped gate.
- iOS and Android Hermes exports pass, 5,084,274 and 5,068,086 bytes respectively. Actual Expo Go manifests for both platforms report SDK 58.0.0 and a launch asset. These are JavaScript/bundler checks, not native compilation, signing or physical-device acceptance. API health/OpenAPI, allowed CORS and invalid-input smoke checks pass.
- All three existing Chromium runners pass: app refinement, nearby UX and photo recognition. FI/EN, light/dark, narrow/large text, lookup loading/errors, uncertainty/provenance, local data, five points, cancellation/cleanup and isolated photo fixtures remain covered. Loading now uses a held HTTP fixture; navigation/screenshot checks wait for the target content instead of reading transient frames. Assertions remain enabled. No paid/live photo request occurred.
- Fresh audit comparison: SDK 57 and SDK 58 both have 11 high and 1 critical advisory records, with unchanged affected versions and no introduced high/critical IDs. Moderate records drop from 25 to 23; six low remain. `pnpm security:audit` correctly still fails; this migration does not resolve the baseline security gate.
- Before this change, original main `73fed83` had a [failed CI run](https://github.com/roopeaal/KierratysAppi/actions/runs/39461372769): frozen install and `pnpm validate` passed, Expo project health failed, and the audit step was skipped. Public Doctor details were unavailable. The [October 26 scheduled Security run](https://github.com/roopeaal/KierratysAppi/actions/runs/40306584979) on the same commit passed CodeQL but failed Gitleaks with a leak-detection annotation. Candidate values were not inspected; that finding remains unresolved and predates this patch.
- Fresh original-checkout frozen install, `pnpm validate` (364 tests, all required checks and builds), `pnpm validate:mobile` (218 overlapping tests), Expo compatibility, peer checks and Doctor 20/20 pass. The first sandboxed run failed because the importer regression could not spawn Node (`EPERM`); the unchanged test passes with subprocess access.
- All three browser suites also pass against the original checkout. Initial runs timed out on manual/nearby controls; a second app run read the Home legal control before it was visible. Sequential warm runs pass every unchanged assertion. The app diagnostic copy adds failure capture only under ignored `work/`; no application code, assertions or tracked waits changed during these reruns. Home/manual/nearby-dark-large/photo-English screenshots were inspected. Both original-checkout iOS/Android Expo Go manifests report SDK 58.0.0 with launch assets. Logs are `/workspace/.cloud-onboarding/kierratysappi/original-sdk58-*`, including `browser-app-diagnostic.log`, `browser-nearby-attempt2.log` and `browser-photo.log` with that prefix. These checks do not replace original-checkout phone acceptance.
- Test-repository logs are `/workspace/.cloud-onboarding/kierratysappi/sdk58-*.log`; ignored native exports and browser evidence are under `work/`. The original-repository implementation/configuration/lockfile/QA changes match the tested commit exactly. The owner reports that Expo Go works in the test repository; original-checkout phone checks remain pending. Existing photo capture still requires its compatible development build. The `mobile` / `backend` / `shared` ownership is unchanged. The owner approved committing and pushing this upgrade to `roopeaal/KierratysAppi/main` after successful test-repository device testing. Publication receipts are retained under ignored `work/sdk58-publication/`; remote CI results must be checked separately.

## Authorized team-main integration — 2026-10-20

- **Actual publication:** dry-run then non-force `HEAD:refs/heads/main` push succeeds **`44cc1b2..7ff234e`** to verified `https://github.com/roopeaal/KierratysAppi.git`. Independent `git ls-remote` returns **`7ff234e9b3801ed2dca482297d241d154d48fc84`**; both parents (`3233a3a`, `44cc1b2`) pass ancestor checks. No force/rebase/private import/settings/tag/other-branch push. Outcome documentation follows in the same authorized sharing step.
- **Final checks:** post-documentation/final-Privacy full validation exits 0 in `validate-prepush.log` with the same **364 unique tests**, gates/builds/14 routes. `app-browser-final.log` rechecks the final Privacy wording and exits 0. All three browser runs pass. Entire staged publish delta has 65 files; limited prohibited-path and key-pattern check of eleven local commit patches + staged delta yields zero candidates. No raw secrets/private environment/profile/binary/work artifacts are committed; this limited check is not a Gitleaks/security-audit claim.
- **Initial remote CI snapshot:** source commit `7ff234e` launches CI **39461165652** (queued) and Security **39461165262** (in progress). No completed conclusion at that snapshot; remote checks are not certified by local green tests. Final outcome/follow-up SHA is verified separately if available; broader native/production gates remain open.
- Owner explicitly confirms **KierratysAppi/main**. URL/public/default/main verified; fresh remote `44cc1b2` is nine commits ahead of the common base, local `3233a3a` has eleven separate commits. Normal merge preserves both, with project-state/NEXT/ROADMAP conflicts reconciled rather than dropping either history. Source sharing is not production publication; no private KeepItGreen import, force/rebase or settings change.
- Initial merged mobile typecheck fails on eight missing-translation references in upstream manual search. Its old single-point screen also drops plural/material/one-press/accuracy behavior and adds direct unbounded public Nominatim requests. Reconciled it with existing cards/intent/provenance and installed native `Location.geocodeAsync` (local SDK source/type contract inspected). Explicit FI/EN recipient/retention disclosure, 160-character query/control validation, bounded typed coordinates, ambiguous-match refusal, five-second deadline, single-flight uncancellable native request, cancel/late-result/late-permission protection and non-GPS estimated-origin label added. Web never collects an address for an unavailable geocoder. Postal/subregion correction, Home async cleanup, heading and shared filter retained. Shared exclusion filtering/regression and a namespaced upstream decision ID avoid trust/ID collisions.
- Focused initial helper/address tests pass 11/11; added deadline/late-permission case makes helper 8 plus address 4. Scoped shared **85**, scoped mobile **218 overlapping** tests pass. Full pinned `pnpm validate` passes **364 unique = 70 policy + 294 application** (domain 52/database 5/localization 7/engine 8/contracts 25/providers 42/mobile 126/application 8/API 21), all boundaries/format/lint/strict types/package/API builds and 14 routes. Initial test-double arity type error is repaired, not a passing run; old logs retained. Existing non-failing lint notices remain; no gate relaxed.
- All three actual-Metro/installed-Chrome browser runners exit 0: nearby preserves one-press versus direct URL, five-point distance/material/exclusion/source/map behavior, offline/denied/cancel/timeout cleanup, dark/narrow/synthetic large text and FI/EN native-only address notice with no address input; broader app and photo fixture regressions pass. Inspected `work/nearby-ux-qa/manual-web-fi.png` and `fi-dark.png`; no overlap/overflow observed in those scoped views. Public fixture positions and isolated camera/API responses only, no user GPS/photo/geocoder or live inference. Browser success does not establish native address form/provider/permission/map/VoiceOver behavior.
- Ignored integration evidence: `work/team-main-push-2026-10-20.D1ww05/{validate.log,validate-final.log,validate-prepush.log,mobile.log,mobile-final.log,shared.log,nearby-browser.log,app-browser.log,app-browser-final.log,photo-browser.log}`. Initial failing checks are retained separately from their passing reruns. No real geocoding query/GPS/photo, paid provider call, native build/install/signing change or new dependency/account. Native address acceptance remains pending under OA-NEARBY-ADDRESS-01; public NO-GO/PHOTO-003 high unchanged.

## Owner trust and actual same-app startup — 2026-10-20

- Owner reports **luotettu**. Without reinstall/reset, beta CoreDevice launches the same installed build 2 using the current Metro dev-client payload; exit 0 / JSON outcome success. Two later targeted process queries find the returned PID. This is actual startup evidence after changed trust state, not an inference from signatures/host health. No camera/GPS/paid request, helper renewal or GitHub push.
- One native screenshot visually shows current FI Home (scan/manual/photo, plural nearby, guide/history, Privacy), partly occluded by an unrelated OS picture-in-picture overlay. Removed only the exact newly generated mixed-content regular file after path/type checks; no original phone content, no mixed image retained or further capture. This is rendered-Home evidence, not unobstructed visual acceptance, interaction, retention, camera/material-review/accessibility/performance or untethered/Mac-independent evidence.
- Fresh full pinned **`pnpm validate` exits 0, 354 unique tests (69 policy + 285 application)**, boundaries/format/lint/strict types/package/API builds and 14 routes. No behavior/test/dependency/native/prompt/model/rule change or new security-audit/Doctor/remote-CI claim. Existing-account product provisioning now passes; the older helper No Accounts error is historical, not a currently reproduced blocker.
- Ignored `work/ios-renewal-2026-10-20.xwM2qA/`: `launch-after-trust.{json,log}`, `processes-after-trust.json`, `processes-trusted-later.json`, `screenshot-after-trust.json`, bounded `trusted-launch-verification.json`, `validate-trusted-launch.log` and post-documentation `validate-trusted-final.log`. First failed launch/profile/build receipts remain separate. Actual expiry **October 27 17:27:13 Helsinki (UTC+2)** unchanged, manual renewal not scheduled. Debug still requires Mac Metro/API/LAN. EB-IOS-TRUST-01 resolved for startup; PHOTO-003 high/PHOTO-004/wider native and production NO-GO remain.

## Approved three-cache cleanup and actual renewal/install — 2026-10-20

- Fresh approved-target preflight: three exact old DeviceSupport directories, real directory/root identity and exact expected children, no open files, 13,744 files/12,558 directories/zero symlinks, allocated 19,225,964,544 bytes. Safe postorder unlink/rmdir completes **26,302 objects** with current 24A5430a support root identity preserved, no traversal/force/retry. Immediate free bytes 213,450,752 → 19,452,891,136; no claim every background variation is cleanup. Source/Xcode/simulators/app/live build/rollback/phone data excluded; removed cache copies are not in Trash and old beta reacquisition is not guaranteed.
- Prior No Accounts is superseded by available existing account. Generic build then fails Apple no-device provisioning; stable `-showdestinations` lists the same connected phone, whose UDID matches prior provisioned-device evidence. Documented `-allowProvisioningDeviceRegistration` with that physical destination and existing provisioning permission yields **exit 0 / BUILD SUCCEEDED**. No SDK/account/team/app/native-config/lock/dependency change, force or profile deletion.
- Strict app + **all 12 embedded-framework** signatures, current ID/version 0.1.0/build 2/iOS 26.5 SDK, default/compiled FI/EN camera purpose, foreground-only location, app/profile/team/application/device bindings pass. Actual profile created **2026-10-20T15:27:13Z**, expires **2026-10-27T15:27:13Z / 27.10.2026 17:27:13 Helsinki** (UTC+2). New actual dates, not inferred seven-day math; no year-end/distribution readiness or automation.
- Replacement install outcome **success**; exact-bundle physical inventory confirms 0.1.0/build 2. No uninstall/reset or private-content read; retention not proven. Initial explicit dev-client launch is **rejected** (CoreDevice 10002/FBS Security alternatives). Mac signatures do not establish trust or rendered UI; owner Trust/Verify check is pending before another launch attempt. No in-scope or other-app screenshot captured in this unit.
- Correct-worktree listener cwd, LAN API health/capabilities and iOS manifest/asset pass. Bundle HTTP 200, **11,744,969 bytes**, expected API origin/new material-choice keys; no provider inference POST or budget reset. Host success is not phone-startup/performance evidence.
- After cleanup **`pnpm validate:mobile` exits 0, 209 overlapping tests**; **`pnpm validate` exits 0, 354 unique tests (69 policy + 285 application)** and all format/lint/types/boundaries/package/API/14-route build gates. Earlier ENOSPC is resolved for these reruns. No new test cases/source/dependency, live security audit/Doctor/remote-CI or physical camera/VoiceOver claim. Logs/receipts/backup remain ignored under `work/ios-renewal-2026-10-20.xwM2qA/`; no raw profile/device ID/binary in Git. No paid AI request, secret/billing/private-repository/global-Xcode change or push; production NO-GO unchanged.

## Signing/install renewal preflight and storage inventory — 2026-10-20

- Clean `fc433bc`, matched native locks, same app ID/version/build 2, Xcode 26.6/iOS 26.5 confirmed. Actual embedded profile expires October 19 09:49:04 UTC / 12:49:04 Helsinki. Strict app signature before/after failed build, APFS recovery-copy signature and profile equality pass. Stable automatic provisioning build exits 65, No Accounts/no matching development profile, with zero compile/sign steps; **renewal/install/launch are not passed**.
- Native Xcode GUI initially has no account; existing-account login sheet is opened without entering credentials. Owner follow-up now shows existing account/Personal Team; CoreDevice observes connected intended phone, iOS 27.0/24A5430a. Credential usability still needs a new provisioning result. No screenshot of the phone, camera/GPS acquisition or physical app flow was run.
- Fresh full pinned `pnpm validate` exits 0: **354 tests (69 policy + 285 application)**, boundaries/format/lint/types/package/API builds and 14 routes. A later `pnpm validate:mobile` exits 1: **ENOSPC during shared-domain Vitest temp-directory creation**, not a scoped pass or a newly isolated application defect. Free space fell from about 3.1 GiB initially to 140–202 MiB; cause not attributed and further builds stop. Existing non-failing lint/build notices remain.
- Read-only `du`/exact directory inspection identifies obsolete DeviceSupport versions 26.1/23B82 (5.2 GiB), 27.0/24A5418b (6.3 GiB), 27.0/24A5424a (6.3 GiB). Top-level children are symbol-processing markers, Info.plist and Symbols. Current phone's 24A5430a support (about 18 GiB), simulator data, source/live DerivedData/recovery are excluded. Some protected general cache paths deny inspection; no access bypass. Sizes may include shared APFS blocks; no promised reclaimed-byte count. **No deletion yet; owner approval requested for only those three roots.**
- Evidence remains ignored under `work/ios-renewal-2026-10-20.xwM2qA/`: `build.log`, `validate.log`, `mobile-validation.log`, device/build settings and rollback app. Source/dependencies/model/API/rules/database/native config are unchanged; no paid inference/key/account purchase/private import or GitHub push. Complete storage recovery, then rerun checks and actual signing/install/launch; production NO-GO unchanged.

## Independent photo-part material correction — 2026-10-15

- Started clean at `d4ae7d2`; actual generic confirmation used raw `part.material`. Three added mobile tests replay the recorded Nutella plastic-jar error and verify independent glass choice, untouched inferred identity, sourced glass policy/medium rather than verified observation, missing/unknown/invalid choices and unsupported/non-packaging refusal. With new confirmation inputs against the old implementation, four test cases fail; after repair **11/11** focused photo tests pass. Existing risky/uncertain/deposit/paper cases remain.
- `pnpm validate:mobile`: exit 0, **209 overlapping tests** (domain 52, localization 7, engine 8, contracts 24, mobile 118), scoped format/lint/types/builds. `pnpm validate`: exit 0, **354 unique tests = 69 repository-policy + 285 application** (52 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 24 + 42 + 118 + 8 + 21), mandatory boundary/format/lint/strict types, all package/API builds and 14 web routes. Existing informational Biome template-literal suggestions and NO_COLOR build warnings remain non-failing; no gate was removed. Pinned pnpm 11.16.0, local Node 26.4.0; CI's Node 24 was not newly run remotely.
- Actual Metro 8093 / installed Chrome / Playwright **photo, app-refinement and nearby browser runners all exit 0**. Photo runner intercepts every capability/inference request using isolated synthetic camera/public-response fixtures; no real provider call. Checks no default material, separate false→true safety state and disabled control, keyboard unknown selection, original wrong plastic suggestion→local glass guidance, independent lid/third part, removal on uncheck/material change, same-radio no-op, unknown→existing markings route, source/confidence, unsafe/uncertain/non-packaging/unknown raw refusal, consent/metadata/cancel/late-result/background/offline/disabled/quota behavior, FI/EN/light/dark/reduced-motion and 320-point/130% text layout. Initial harness assertions were corrected to use actual enabled semantics (RN Web omits false aria-disabled) and scope material radios rather than the retained Home language radio. Large-text emulation snapshots computed text sizes before scaling, avoiding compounded relative percentages; it is not native Dynamic Type. Broader runners retain previous barcode/product/history/privacy/nearby regressions without live provider or user GPS data.
- Screenshots inspected: `work/photo-qa/fi-material-unselected.png`, `fi-material-unknown.png`, `fi-nutella-corrected.png`, `fi-material-320-large.png`, `fi-confirmed-dark.png`, `fi-rule-dark.png`, `en-material-unknown.png`, `en-material-corrected.png`. Existing visual tokens, compact material labels, checked/focus cues and 44-point targets; no new decorative animation, dependency or tracking. Synthetic screenshots are not runtime data or a fresh real-image recognition score.
- Reproduce from repository root with the existing pinned toolchain: `pnpm --filter @kierratysappi/mobile test src/features/photo/__tests__/sorting.test.ts`, `pnpm validate:mobile`, `pnpm validate`. For browser runners set the documented installed `PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE_PATH` and `BROWSER_EXECUTABLE_PATH`, then run `node scripts/qa/photo-recognition-browser.cjs`, `node scripts/qa/app-refinement-browser.cjs`, `node scripts/qa/nearby-ux-browser.cjs` against local Metro 8093. Logs: `work/photo-material-{mobile-validation,validate,browser,app-browser,nearby-browser}.log`; post-documentation full rerun: `work/photo-material-final-validate.log`.
- Scope: **local correction/unknown mitigation, not improved model material accuracy**. PHOTO-003 stays high/open and PHOTO-004 naming unchanged. No new paid request/key/model/prompt/API/wire/rule/date/database/native build/sign/install, real phone photograph, private-repository import or GitHub push. Latest native controls/file cleanup/VoiceOver/large text remain unverified under existing acceptance; public production NO-GO is unchanged. Prior eight-call permission is exhausted; further empirical inference requires fresh bounded approval.

## Eight real product front images, owner-approved live evaluation — 2026-10-15

- Existing-key reuse explicitly approved. Eight source images inspected and expected labels recorded before testing. Exactly eight app `POST /v1/recycling/photo` requests, no retries, at least 25-second spacing, same recognizer/model/prompt and development budget. All return HTTP 200/`estimated`; ledger has eight attempts/eight results. Four mention the brand/product family. Seven FI product types appropriate; Quaker's FI wording is imprecise versus its broader EN label. Exact table, references, SHA-256 and caveats: `PHOTO_PRODUCT_EVALUATION.md`.
- **Model-quality failure retained:** Nutella's jar inferred plastic rather than the glass reference corroborated by the manufacturer; not treated as safe verified sorting. PHOTO-003 high remains open. Coarse category-keyword matches are 8/8 but not semantic correctness: Quaker exposes the distinction. No representative success percentage, material-completeness/accuracy, verified GTIN or new native-camera pass is claimed.
- Added pinned public-only eight-case manifest and explicit-opt-in harness: no answer/code/name URL in request, bounded JPEG/response, hash verification, fixed loopback app endpoint, exclusive run marker, spacing/deadline/no retry/no secret access. Seven free regressions pass for opt-in/cap/source isolation/answer separation/name-vs-type/fake verification/coarse keyword limits. No production app/model/rule/dependency behavior changed; no raw photos in Git.
- Full pinned `pnpm validate` exits 0 with **351 unique tests (69 policy + 282 application)**, all format/lint/strict types/boundaries, package/API builds and 14 web routes. Both `validate.log` and the post-documentation `final-validate.log` pass. Logs and public input/response/attempt receipts remain ignored in `work/photo-products-2026-10-15.KstrPe/`. Final read-only verification confirms eight attempts/eight responses and unchanged adapter/route/contracts/rule content. Eight-call permission is consumed; no further paid test/model switch, account/billing/native change or GitHub push.

## Direct physical result inspection and paper-confirmation repair — 2026-10-15

- Supported beta CoreDevice help documents `device capture screenshot --device ... --destination ...`. Bounded capture succeeds and the actual app-result image is inspected: inferred estimate, indicative confidence, expected pinned model/photo-observation version/time and two paper-packaging parts. No original photograph inspected or new capture/upload/inference initiated; user previously reported taking/sending the image. This verifies native response rendering, not precise product/material accuracy, native file cleanup or post-confirmation guidance.
- Paper parts incorrectly displayed the uncertain fallback because `canConfirmPhotoPart` omitted paper while existing `fi.packaging.carton` includes it. Added two regressions and observed failures: shared expected true/got false, mobile expected resolved/got undefined. After the one-value allowlist repair, focused contracts **9/9** and mobile photo **8/8** pass. Loose/non-packaging/unknown paper and hazardous/uncertain estimates remain blocked; unconfirmed input cannot issue guidance. Existing rule source/date/version/confidence remain intact.
- Shared scope **84 overlapping tests** and mobile scope **206** pass, including boundaries/format/lint/types/builds. Expanded actual-Metro browser runner passes explicit paper confirmation → source-backed carton guidance, no instruction before confirmation, non-packaging-paper refusal and existing camera/preview/consent/unsafe/uncertain/cancellation/visibility/offline/disabled/quota/FI/EN checks. Fixtures are browser-only; no native estimate injection or provider call. Paper-rule screenshot inspected separately from the physical result.
- Initial in-scope native screenshot retained only under ignored `work/photo-native-test-2026-10-15.W1gGnB/current-screen.png`. Two later captures showed another app/OS transition; their generated copies were removed with exact path/type/realpath/inode validation, not used as app evidence and no original phone data changed. Activation succeeds with the same PID, but no stable post-fix native guidance/background-clearing claim is made. No more screenshots while the owner is using other apps. XCTest helper provisioning remains separate; the direct screenshot path needs no helper renewal/auth bypass.
- Full pinned `pnpm validate` exits 0 with **344 unique tests (62 policy + 282 application)**, all format/lint/strict types/boundaries, package/API builds and 14 web routes. No skipped/downgraded gate. Logs: `validate.log`, `shared.log`, `mobile.log`, `paper-{contract,mobile}-{before,after}.log`, `browser-paper-final.log` in the ignored evidence directory. No secret, raw image/estimate, device identifier/profile or native binary committed; no new dependency, model/rule/date/native signing change or GitHub push.

## Photo camera-entry regression repair — 2026-10-15

- User-reported failure occurs at **Ota tuotekuva**, not a demonstrated provider failure. Installed `expo-constants` source/changelog independently shows removed top-level `nativeBuildVersion`; current iOS native service exports `platform.ios.buildNumber` directly from Info.plist. Former guard received undefined and rejected installed build 2 despite earlier green checks.
- Replaced string-only compatibility wiring with a narrow native-runtime object guard. Actual native-shape, old/unknown/malformed build, Expo Go, mutable-manifest disagreement and screen-to-guard wiring regressions pass. Android's empty native platform map fails closed; no Android camera readiness claim.
- Focused photo suite **7/7** and policy suite **4/4** pass. Scoped mobile validation **204 overlapping tests** passes; pinned full `pnpm validate` exits 0 with **342 unique tests (62 policy + 280 application)**, format/lint/strict types/boundaries, package/API builds and 14 web routes. Initial typecheck caught excess fixture fields; fixed the fixture without weakening runtime or compiler checks.
- Expanded actual-Metro photo browser runner passes pending-opening busy/disabled/localized-label checks, no pre-consent POST, synthetic capture/metadata/preview/send/confirmation, hazardous/uncertain blocking, cancellation/late output, visibility/offline/disabled/quota, FI/EN/dark/layout. Inspected `work/photo-qa/fi-opening.png`; fixtures are not native camera/provider evidence.
- Existing build 2 relaunched successfully using the current Metro URL, no rebuild/reinstall/signing change. Owner subsequently reports camera opens, a photo was taken and send pressed. **No actual result/error text or successful provider/sorting outcome observed yet.** Native deletion, metadata, permission/background and accessibility acceptance remain separate. No user image in chat or assistant billable call.
- Native helper remains blocked as documented. Read-only Metro inspector WebSocket rejects with HTTP 401; no runtime values/UI/photo were read and no authentication bypass attempted. Host API/capabilities/Metro remain healthy. No GitHub push or new external account/payment action.
- Ignored logs: `work/photo-camera-entry-{mobile,validate,final-validate,browser}.log`, native relaunch JSON/log. Final full validation after the documentation/QA changes also exits 0 with the same 342 tests and all gates. Existing native signatures/profile/build evidence retains its earlier scope and October 19 expiry.

## Approved cache cleanup and native build 2 — 2026-10-15

- Explicit owner approval followed by fresh exact-target/type/child/creation/
  link validation. Removed ten download-cache-copy directories, 8,826 files and
  nine symlinks without traversing links, force/retries or touching installed
  pods/source/phone data. Measured available bytes 1,035,653,120 → 2,064,412,672;
  installed native locks unchanged. Receipt: `cache-cleanup.jsonl`.
- Preserved signature-verified APFS build-1 clone. Fresh Xcode 26.6/iOS 26.5
  Debug build exits 0 / BUILD SUCCEEDED. Version 0.1.0/build 2, same ID, strict
  app/all 12 framework signatures, compiled default/FI/EN camera purpose and
  foreground-only location, app/profile/team/device bindings pass. Existing
  profile expires October 19 at 12:49:04 Helsinki; not renewed.
- First bounded install fails at CoreDevice 4000/reset. Later fresh metadata
  confirms connected/DDI-ready state; second bounded replacement install passes.
  Targeted inventory confirms version 0.1.0/build 2, current dev-client launch
  and later PID-specific query pass. Final relaunch/process check also passes.
  No uninstall/reset or native UI/camera/private-content-retention inference.
- Native inspection helper fails separately: default signing configuration,
  expired observed owner-specific cached profile, then explicit existing-ID
  rebuild reports No Accounts/missing profiles. No native tree/screenshot
  obtained; failed tool sessions closed, product relaunched. Manual owner photo
  smoke requested with explicit upload approval; no assistant capture/upload.
- LAN API/capabilities/Metro/iOS manifest/exact 11,734,094-byte JS asset return
  200; expected current origin/photo contract. These are host checks only.
  No new AI inference request, public service or GitHub push.
- Fresh scoped mobile command passes 203 overlapping dependency tests. Full
  pinned `pnpm validate` exits 0 with **340 unique tests (61 + 279)** and all
  format/lint/types/boundaries/package/API/web build gates; 14 routes. No new
  application source/dependency/test changes or browser/device visual claims.
  Logs/verification summaries remain under ignored
  `work/ios-photo-2026-10-15.CmF8TO/`; exact procedure in physical evidence.

## Native client 2 preflight — 2026-10-15

- Generated ignored iOS project from `mobile/app`: Info.plist build 2, same
  version/ID, FI/EN purpose text. Reverted incidental tracked script edits.
  Saved native lock restored; first pod extraction failed ENOSPC, one retry
  after temporary-file release passed deployment/no-repo-update installation.
  Native lock byte-identical and equal to installed manifest.
- Stable Xcode 26.6/iOS 26.5 build-settings query passes, not native compilation.
  Targeted CoreDevice inventory confirms connected/paired Developer Mode and
  actual installed build 1. Existing cached app/older rollback signatures pass;
  no new signature/profile/installation/launch/camera/visual acceptance.
- Scoped mobile validation passes 203 overlapping dependency tests; fresh full
  pinned `pnpm validate` exits 0: **340 unique tests (61 + 279)**, all boundaries,
  format/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 14-route web export. No new
  runtime/dependency/test changes or browser QA rerun. Logs and metadata under
  ignored `work/ios-photo-2026-10-15.CmF8TO/`.
- About 977 MiB free; build deferred before compilation. Exact ten newly created
  reloadable cache-copy targets and dry-run symlink checks are recorded in
  `PHYSICAL_IOS_VALIDATION.md`; owner cleanup approval is pending. No deletion,
  broader cleanup, additional paid AI request, source publication or push.

## Owner-funded live adapter recheck — 2026-10-15

- Owner reported completing the billing step and authorized the offered single
  test. Existing approved key, pinned model and code-drawn 512×512 JPEG only.
  Direct real adapter request: HTTP 200, calls 1, result `estimated` after full
  runtime schemas. Safe summary: `work/photo-credit-restored-2026-10-15.json`.
- Supersedes the initial exhausted-credit outcome below for this observation.
  No user photo/estimate text/raw provider body/key/payment history exposed, no
  agent purchase/billing change/key rotation/model switch/automatic retry.
  Remaining balance and real-product accuracy are not established.
- This is provider-adapter evidence, not a fresh app HTTP/browser/native test.
  Native client 2 build/install and physical camera/permission/file-deletion/
  background/accessibility acceptance remain pending. No production enablement,
  signing renewal or GitHub push.
- Fresh pinned `pnpm validate` exits 0 after the status updates: **340 tests
  (61 policy + 279 application)**, boundaries/format/lint/strict types, all
  package/API builds and 14-route web export. Documentation/evidence only;
  no runtime/dependency changes or added tests. Ignored full log:
  `work/photo-credit-restored-validate.log`.

## Development-only photo recognition — 2026-10-15

- Full pinned `pnpm validate` passes **340 tests (61 policy + 279 application)**,
  boundaries/format/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 14-route web export.
  All three scoped commands pass: mobile 203 / backend 159 / shared 83 overlapping
  tests. Added 33 unique tests since the prior 307. Ignored logs:
  `work/photo-validate-final.log`, `photo-mobile.log`, `photo-backend.log`,
  `photo-shared.log`. No skipped/downgraded gates or external dependency updates.
- Actual-Metro photo browser runner passes synthetic camera/isolated API flows:
  explicit preview/send/confirmation, metadata, hazard/uncertainty blocking,
  cancel/late-result/visibility/offline/disabled/quota, FI/EN, light/dark and web
  width checks. Both existing app and nearby runners still pass their previous
  source/error/local-state/material/keyboard/offline/dark/synthetic-text flows.
  Photo screenshots inspected; not physical-camera or native text-scale proof.
- Actual API: model access 200; provider diagnostics first exposed schema
  compatibility, then 429 `credit_balance_exhausted`, type `insufficient_quota`.
  Conservative wire schema plus full runtime checking and distinct credit error
  handling/regressions implemented. At this initial stage no successful real
  model estimate was obtained; the later funded recheck above supersedes this
  credit blocker, not the unverified product-accuracy/device scope.
- Approved key stored only in ignored backend env file (0600), never printed or
  committed. No agent funds purchased, native prebuild/build/install/signing,
  physical camera attempt, production enablement or GitHub push. Native config/locales
  now require build 2; old build 1/Expo Go are gated for truthful permission use.
- Full source references, commands, actual failure scope and next native task:
  `PHOTO_RECOGNITION_EVIDENCE.md`, `../research/photo-ai-boundary-2026-10-15.md`.

## Explicit KierratysAppi main publication — 2026-10-12

- Verified actual `origin` fetch/push URL, default `main` and unchanged public
  visibility. Fresh fetch: 0 remote-only / 7 local-only commits; reviewed history
  and 195-file aggregate diff. Whitespace checks pass; changed-file metadata has
  no ignored work/native-output/private environment/signing artifacts. This is
  not an exhaustive secret scan. KeepItGreen and remote settings untouched.
- Fresh full pinned `pnpm validate` exits 0: **307 tests (58 policy + 249
  application)**, boundaries/format/lint/types, package/API builds and 13-route
  web export. Ignored log: `work/team-push-2026-10-12-validate.log`.
- Non-force `git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/main` succeeds, `b9c3ac7..7e6d5bd`.
  Independent `git ls-remote origin refs/heads/main` matches local source SHA
  `7e6d5bd919e7a0cb0cf2095797575e751c3a1ac5`. Outcome documentation follows in
  this same authorized sharing step; no future automatic push is authorized.
- Source-push GitHub runs [38244798816](https://github.com/roopeaal/KierratysAppi/actions/runs/38244798816)
  and [38244798714](https://github.com/roopeaal/KierratysAppi/actions/runs/38244798714)
  were `in_progress` when checked, not passed evidence. No new native build/
  install/signing, browser/device acceptance or production release is claimed.

## Partition documentation clarification — 2026-10-12

- Removed personal role-assignment wording and documented actual independent
  implementation/test paths and shared-contract/runtime requirements. Checked
  current package manifests, dependency direction rules, scoped commands and the
  existing isolated HTTP browser fixture runner; no production fixtures added.
- Re-ran full pinned `pnpm validate`, exit 0: **307 tests (58 policy + 249
  application)**, boundary/format/lint/strict types, package/API builds and
  13-route web export pass. Ignored log: `work/partition-clarification-validate.log`.
- Documentation-only change; no new behavior/test cases, dependency updates,
  signing/install, browser/native acceptance, Git-history rewrite or GitHub push.
  Earlier physical/browser evidence and remaining acceptance scope stay intact.

## Three-part source ownership — 2026-10-12

- Full pinned `pnpm validate` exits 0: **307 tests (58 policy + 249 application)**,
  mandatory AST/public-export/DAG/compiler-path guard, format/lint/strict types,
  package/API builds and 13-route export. Eleven boundary cases and three frozen
  v1 cases are new; moved collection tests retain coverage. Final ignored log:
  `work/three-part-validate-final.log`.
- All scoped validations pass: mobile 188 / backend 136 / shared 75 tests,
  with overlapping shared dependencies, not additional unique tests. Mobile
  closure excludes server/database and backend does not build Expo. Three CI
  part jobs added alongside full integration; no remote CI/settings claim.
- Offline/frozen dependency relinking passes without changing external versions/
  integrities or age policy. OSM snapshot, SQL migration and rule file match
  baseline bytes. No real database migration or secret/account action.
- Both actual-Metro browser runners pass prior FI/EN/source/error/offline/local-
  state/one-press/material/keyboard/dark/large-text flows; visuals inspected.
  Runtime API/iOS manifest/exact launch asset HTTP 200, 11,605,710-byte JS bundle,
  current API/nearby code and no known backend implementation classes in client.
  Actual existing iPhone Home reload/button/1284×2778 screenshot check passes,
  without GPS/camera acquisition, native rebuild/sign/install or wider acceptance.
- Current web entry: 3,803,444 bytes / 720,054 gzip; warning budget still exceeded,
  no performance pass. Detailed commands/scoping/compatibility/limits:
  `PROJECT_PARTITION_EVIDENCE.md`. No GitHub push/private-code import or new blocker;
  current development profile remains October 19, 12:49:04 Helsinki.

## Owner-requested development signing renewal — 2026-10-12

- Source `4e79895`, unchanged native dependencies and matched pods. Xcode 26.6
  Debug build exits 0 / `BUILD SUCCEEDED`; new embedded profile creation
  2026-10-12 09:49:04 UTC and expiry **2026-10-19 09:49:04 UTC / 12:49:04 Helsinki**.
  Old app/profile kept recoverably; no broad deletion/uninstall/reset or push.
- Strict recursive app and all 12 framework signatures pass; expected device,
  app/team entitlements and foreground-only declaration match. Beta CoreDevice
  replacement install outcome success, physical launch and later exact-PID
  presence pass. Container path changed; local-content retention not inspected.
- Actual Finnish Home and exact **Lähimmät pisteet** visible-button assertion
  pass using the physical XCTest helper. Home screenshot inspected at 1284×2778;
  native icons/tiles/material subtitle/Privacy control present, development/tool
  overlays remain. No GPS/camera acquisition, nearby/material/map/Privacy-content,
  dark/large-text/VoiceOver, battery, disconnected-wire or release acceptance.
- Restored stopped API/Metro at current LAN origin; health/status/iOS manifest
  and exact launch bundle HTTP 200, 11,602,981 bytes and latest nearby keys.
  Actual bundle also contains the current LAN API origin. After closing the
  automation session, CoreDevice foreground launch still succeeds with the same
  product PID, leaving the app open; no active automation session is retained.
  This is still a Mac-hosted-runtime-dependent Debug client, not standalone.
- Full pinned `pnpm validate` exit 0: **293 tests (47 policy + 246 application)**,
  format/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13-route export. Ignored log:
  `work/ios-renewal-2026-10-12/validate-final.log`. No new runtime behavior or dependency
  change; no new unit-case/Doctor/live security/provider/remote-CI claim needed.
- Detailed procedure, corrected diagnostic/tooling errors and evidence scope:
  `PHYSICAL_IOS_VALIDATION.md`. No new external blocker or GitHub push. Manual
  next renewal before October 19, 12:49 Helsinki; no scheduled automation.

## One-press nearby points and school-scope privacy — 2026-10-11

- Pinned `pnpm validate` exits 0: **293 tests (47 policy + 246 application)**,
  formatting/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13-route web export.
  Final ignored log: `work/nearby-points-validate-2026-10-11-final.log`.
  Narrow importer 6/6 and mobile 107/107 pass. New distance/material/schema,
  cached-date, intent, localized-label and appearance-store regressions cover
  the behavior; source policies preserve optional consent and visible evidence.
- Both expanded actual-Metro browser runners pass FI/EN, one-press versus direct
  URL, five independently ranked real IDs, known/missing/excluded reception,
  source/date/non-verification, first-map viewport, offline local refresh,
  denial/cancellation/timeout and watcher cleanup, keyboard details, live dark,
  320/390 and 130% synthetic text. Whole-app existing fixture/result/local-data
  flows and factual Privacy pass at 320/390/1280 widths. Updated visuals inspected.
- Real browser loading/theme race repaired: dark media with light surface after
  navigation/loading now passes exact computed-background checks with a shared
  external-store subscription/recheck. Corrected the QA-only cleanup assertion
  to account for Expo's two underlying subscription removals, without relaxing
  application teardown tests. Full procedures/limitations:
  `NEARBY_POINTS_EVIDENCE.md`.
- Live OSM refresh failed; genuine October 6 raw cache re-normalized as v2 with
  original dates. 5,753 records, 1,925 affirmative-report and 292 exclusion-bearing
  records; missing values remain unknown. No user GPS or production test fixtures.
- Final web entry `entry-337e32ce1a5208173ad1253c33e0f5e0.js`: 3,802,800 bytes /
  719,815 gzip. It remains above warning budget, not a performance/battery pass.
  No latest native permission/list/layout/accessibility/address/map acceptance,
  signing/install, remote CI, live security/provider audit, GitHub push or release.
  No legal-review blocker is imposed on this school UI task; future public
  production NO-GO remains separate. Native scoped acceptance is next.

## Home recognition and visual polish — 2026-10-08

- Pinned `pnpm validate`: exit 0, **276 tests (43 policy + 233 application)**,
  formatting/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13-route web export.
  Ignored final log: `work/location-2026-10-06/home-recognition-validate-final.log`.
- Nine new tile width/font-scale/stacking tests and two source-policy cases;
  narrow mobile design policy passes 11/11. Native icons are decorative with
  no extra focus targets, no animation or new package. Source/arithmetic checks
  do not establish physical Dynamic Type/VoiceOver.
- Both optional actual-Metro browser runners pass FI/EN and existing safe
  error/source/local-data flows. Added hidden-icon checks, visible keyboard
  focus/Enter guide navigation, 390 px two-column / 320 px stacked tiles and
  per-word wrapping at 130% synthetic text. Home also checked at 1280 px.
  Light/dark/large screenshots inspected; an actual Finnish orphan-letter
  defect was repaired and regressed. No user data/location captured.
- Latest web entry: 3,375,116 bytes / 698,216 gzip, above the existing warning
  budget, not a performance or battery pass. Detailed repairs/reproduction:
  `APP_REFINEMENT_EVIDENCE.md`.
- No latest native appearance/camera/accessibility/geocoding acceptance,
  signing/install, live security/provider audit, GitHub CI, push or release.
  Existing production NO-GO and owner gates unchanged; native Home is next.

## Whole-app copy cleanup — 2026-10-08

- Pinned `pnpm validate`: exit 0, **265 tests (41 policy + 224 application)**,
  formatting/lint/types, package/API builds and 13-route web export. Ignored log:
  `work/location-2026-10-06/plain-language-validate.log`.
- Narrow mobile design policy 9/9 and localization 6/6 pass. Four new regressions
  retain contextual purpose/legal/uncertainty while preventing blanket Home
  reassurance, false rule-review loading copy, hidden history clearing and
  ambiguous local-feedback status.
- Both optional actual-Metro browser runners pass FI/EN, recovery/results/source
  fields, material-code confirmation/ambiguity/unknown, local history enable and
  disable/clear, unsent drafts, legal markers, offline guide/nearby, dark mode,
  130% synthetic text and Home 320/390/1280 widths. User data/location untouched;
  all products in isolated UI tests are labelled QA fixtures.
- Updated light/dark/large screenshots inspected; detail and QA-authoring repairs
  are in `APP_REFINEMENT_EVIDENCE.md`. Web entry is 3,368,747 bytes / 695,441 gzip;
  remains above budget, not a performance pass.
- No latest native-device text/layout, camera, VoiceOver, Dynamic Type or OS
  geocoding/map-handoff pass. No signing/reinstall/GitHub push; no new external
  blocker or release-readiness change.

## Whole-app refinement — 2026-10-08

- Full pinned local validation passes: **261 tests (39 policy + 222 application)**,
  format/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13 web routes. Nine new
  history-presentation and three new design-policy regressions. Final log:
  ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/app-refinement-validate.log`.
- Both actual-UI browser runners pass with installed Playwright/Chrome.
  FI/EN, manual invalid/no-request and keyboard activation, distinct product
  failure/offline/missing states, two-component resolved/unknown fixture with
  provenance/licence, local ambiguity/confirmation/history/drafts/legal markers,
  dark/130% synthetic text and 320/390/1280 Home widths. Nearby retains map-first,
  offline/source/unknown safeguards using synthetic public-point GPS.
- Current Metro iOS manifest and its exact launch asset both return HTTP 200;
  development JS bundle is 10,958,874 bytes. Local API `/v1/health` returns
  `status=ok`, version 0.1.0. This establishes local service/bundle generation,
  not new physical startup or a native/release build.
- Final exported web entry `entry-817cc3f3545fc2533f84ad89cd3d8437.js`:
  3,372,352 bytes / 696,516 bytes gzip, still above the existing 2 MiB warning
  budget. No measured load-time, native performance or battery improvement claim.
- Visual inspection, exact reproducible commands, repaired overflow/test-selector
  defects and fixture limitations: `APP_REFINEMENT_EVIDENCE.md`. No new native
  build/device acceptance, performance/battery benchmark, live provider/security
  audit, GitHub CI or release claim. No push in this work unit.

## Authorized team publication preflight — 2026-10-08

- Fresh full pinned `pnpm validate` passes, exit 0: 249 tests (36 policy + 213 application), format/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13 routes. Log: ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/team-push-validate-2026-10-08.log`.
- Actual `git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/main` succeeds without force: `39f8aa6..3df2437`. Remote main confirmed `3df2437be5df3c20a1e7134867f9a966f691543f`. GitHub API identifies existing repository as public/default main; visibility unchanged. Immediate workflow query returns no runs yet, not a CI success. Follow-up evidence commit belongs to the same explicitly authorized sharing step; no private-repository push or production release.

- Explicit owner authorization names KierratysAppi. Fresh remote main is `39f8aa65b72befcb43c5c1440dbca1b02b335edf`, an ancestor of implementation `0324c0d0f78f0218b5c95c4b33c8df20eac12a98` (0 remote-only / 10 local-only commits). Reviewed history/diff, clean worktree and passing aggregate whitespace check. Changed filename inventory includes no environment/credential artifacts, screenshots/work directories or built native app. Not a secret-scanner or production release pass.

## Nearby UX and theme coherence — 2026-10-08

- Final post-runner/shared-disabled-state rerun also passes, exit 0: same 249 tests and all validation gates. Log: ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/nearby-ux-validate-complete-2026-10-08.log`. Committed browser runner also passes using Enter to expand the focused details control, then collapses it again. No new physical-device evidence.

- Full pinned `pnpm validate` passes, exit 0: **249 tests (36 policy + 213 application)**, formatting/lint/strict types, builds and 13 web routes. Passing log: ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/nearby-ux-validate-final-2026-10-08.log`. Three new policy cases protect primary map ordering, visible uncertainty/optional consent/loading, expanded ARIA and single reactive theme.
- Optional committed runner `scripts/qa/nearby-ux-browser.cjs` runs against actual Metro 8093 with installed Playwright/Chrome. Synthetic geolocation is at a public bundled point; no user location or native result is read. FI/EN, unknown metadata, map button within the initial 390×844 viewport, details false→true→false, offline local re-search, precise/approximate display and reduced-motion preference pass. Screenshot inspection covers FI light/dark, EN and 130% synthetic browser text with no horizontal overflow; not iOS Dynamic Type.
- Browser run initially exposed missing aria-expanded, repaired with explicit ARIA in addition to native state. Live dark-switch assertion then failed: text/surfaces inconsistent. Shared root AppThemeProvider fixes it; exact screen background RGB(20,34,27) now passes after the media change. Initial QA selector for English incorrectly used button instead of radio and was repaired; this was a test selector issue, not a product defect.
- Screenshots are ignored `work/nearby-ux-qa/{fi-light,fi-dark,fi-large,en}.png`; source runner and rerun procedure: `docs/design/NEARBY_UX.md`. No native OS address lookup/map handoff, actual VoiceOver, release build/store or production GO claim. No new network dependency or push.

## Optional point-area address — 2026-10-08

- Full pinned `pnpm validate` passes after removing an undeclared Zod import from the mobile normalizer and using explicit runtime guards: **246 tests (33 policy + 213 application)**, formatting/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13 routes. Initial typecheck failure is retained in ignored `point-address-validate-2026-10-08.log`; passing run: `work/location-2026-10-06/point-address-validate-final-2026-10-08.log`. Disclosure also appears in the privacy screen. Native service/handoff remains pending; no push.

- Added four tests: bounded address normalization/POI-name exclusion, exact public-coordinate-only lookup and unavailable/offline handling, stalled-provider deadline, pre-abort/in-flight cancellation. Existing identity policy updated for generic unnamed-point heading. No real reverse-geocoding result or physical layout/map-handoff pass claimed; no user coordinates recorded.

## Point map destination — 2026-10-08

- Full pinned `pnpm validate` passes both before and after final privacy-copy update, exit 0: **242 tests (33 policy + 209 application)**, formatting/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13 web routes. Logs: ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/point-map-validate-2026-10-08.log` and `point-map-validate-final-2026-10-08.log`. No new external blocker or production GO.

- Regression verifies exact public-point marker URL for a point lacking an address and rejects invalid coordinates. UI retains known address and adds explicit missing-address fallback/map action. FI/EN privacy copy distinguishes public point coordinates from user location. Native handoff/visual inspection remains pending; no user coordinates captured.

## Nearest-point identity — 2026-10-08

- Full pinned `pnpm validate` passes, exit 0: **241 tests (33 policy + 208 application)**, formatting/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13 web routes. Log: ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/point-identity-validate-2026-10-08.log`. No new external blocker or production GO claim.

- Added a policy regression covering source-provided name, explicit unknown fallback, centre/container/unknown type, address and source identifier rendering. Narrow policy suite passes 4 tests. This is source-level coverage, not a physical layout/accessibility pass. No new native result capture or location details retained; existing device evidence predates this UI change.

## Physical location recovery — 2026-10-08

- Post-permission-cycle full pinned `pnpm validate` passes, exit 0: same 240 tests, formatting/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13 routes. Ignored log: `work/location-2026-10-06/iphone-permission-validate-2026-10-08.log`. Application code remains unchanged.

- Permission restored: owner reports While Using the App; session `team-denial-2026-10-08` returns to nearby and searches. Exact ready-only button wait exits 0 and `is visible 'role="button" label="Päivitä sijainti"'` reports Passed. Scoped denial/restoration cycle passes. Closed only the named testing helper, not the product; no reinstall, location details or push. Earlier pending-restoration statements below describe the pre-restoration attempt.

- Subsequent owner-assisted denial test: Roope reported setting the app-specific location permission to Never. Session `team-denial-2026-10-08` taps the native search control and observes the full Finnish `nearbyPermission` message and **Avaa asetukset** button in a settled UI diff. Closing the screen returns to Home with scan/manual/guide controls present. Denied-state rendering and Home navigation pass; actual use of other features and permission restoration/retry are not yet verified. No location data captured.

- Full pinned `pnpm validate` passes, exit 0: 240 tests (32 policy + 208 application), formatting/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13 web routes. Log: ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/iphone-validate-2026-10-08.log`. Closed only the named automation helper/session afterward; local API/Metro remain available. No new live dependency-audit, release-build or store claim.

- Local API/Metro had stopped; restarted existing team-baseline artifacts. LAN health and iOS manifest/launch asset pass (HTTP 200, 10,954,638 bytes). Explicit development-client relaunch succeeds; native automation subsequently reads Home and nearby introduction.
- Two search actions followed by `wait 'role="button" label="Päivitä sijainti"' 25000` return exit 0. Source restricts that button to the ready state. Background/foreground then exposes `role="button" label="Etsi sijainnillani"`, with product PID 7054 unchanged: scoped native clearing pass, not a process-reset inference.
- Source/explanation label checks are inconclusive (unqualified selectors ambiguous; role="text" selectors unmatched). No full result tree/screenshot, coordinates, nearest-point details or exact distance retained. Fresh consent, denied recovery, physical accuracy and native provider UI remain unverified. Installed source remains 487af03; no push, reinstall or production GO.

## Owner-requested physical retry — 2026-10-07, 22:07 Finland time

- On unchanged installed source `487af03`, the existing helper's signature, phone unlock and API/Metro health pass. Fresh session `team-location-retry-2026-10-07` reaches its listener and reads Home in about 14 seconds; no additional build, install, reset or source change was needed.
- **Actual native Finnish Home and Home → nearby introduction pass** through semantic inspection/tap and screenshots. The introduction retains explicit one-shot/local-only location use, coverage/material/access/hours uncertainty, 6.10.2026 snapshot date and OSM/ODbL attribution. Inspected screenshots at 1284×2778 show no visible text clipping at the current font size; the development gear overlay is not production UI acceptance.
- Starting location was performed, but outcome is **unverified**: alert lookup returned none; safe result/refresh selectors did not match; subsequent captures hit `system_modal_probe_timeout` / `RUNNER_BUSY`. Failed/busy captures are not proof of an absent result, denial or app defect. Asked Roope for the actual permission/result/error state. No GPS, denial/retry, background clearing or native product-source pass is inferred.
- Evidence: ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/iphone-home-retry-2026-10-07.png` and `iphone-nearby-intro-retry-2026-10-07.png`, both captured before requesting location. No location-result/permission-map screenshot, coordinates, point address or actual distance retained. Exact scope and reproduction: `PHYSICAL_IOS_VALIDATION.md`. No GitHub push or release occurred.
- Full pinned `pnpm validate` after the evidence update **passes, exit 0**: 240 tests, formatting/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13 web routes. Log: ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/iphone-retry-validate-2026-10-07.log`. Closed the automation session by naming only its helper app; no runner xcodebuild remained, and a subsequent query confirmed the product's same PID still running. The app was not reinstalled, reset or terminated for this retry.

## Post-trust launch and automation limit — 2026-10-07

- Roope confirmed the trust/verification step. CoreDevice then launched the same installed app successfully; a later filtered process query found KeepItGreen running. **Initial security rejection resolved**, without another product build/install. API/Metro health passes; Home/GPS/source UI is not inferred from process presence.
- Agent-device 0.20.10 first failed to install its own cached runner because its profile had expired. Xcode 27 beta helper renewal succeeds; the changed outer resource seal was repaired using the existing signing identity/entitlements, followed by passing recursive strict verification. This is a separate testing helper, not new product code or a changed product profile.
- Subsequent fresh-session XCTest connection still times out without an inspectable tree. No automated Home or GPS pass, screenshot, coordinate or camera capture is claimed. Owner-visible Home/error/permission confirmation requested; exact next physical procedure is in `PHYSICAL_IOS_VALIDATION.md`/OA-09. Runner transport recovery remains local tooling work, not an external database/paid-account blocker.
- Full pinned **`pnpm validate` passes, exit 0**, 240 tests (32 policy + 208 application), all formatting/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13 web routes, including the post-documentation rerun. Logs: ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/iphone-post-trust-validate-2026-10-07.log` and `iphone-post-trust-validate-final-2026-10-07.log`. Application source remains `487af03`; documentation only changes in this work unit. No push or production release occurred.

## Native renewal and installation — 2026-10-07

- Source `487af03`, same independent team-baseline branch. Retained Xcode 26.6 Debug build now finishes with exit 0 and `BUILD SUCCEEDED`. Pod lock/manifest match. No application source changed in this installation work unit.
- Strict recursive signature plus all **12 embedded framework** checks pass. Embedded profile app/team/device binding and development entitlements match; expires **October 13, 21:21:19 Finland time**. Built Info.plist declares foreground location only, no Always purpose/background mode.
- Connected unlocked iPhone: `devicectl device install app` succeeds over the same bundle ID without uninstalling. Rollback is retained. Pre/post data-container paths differ; actual user-content retention is not independently verified.
- First launch **fails with iOS Security rejection** (signature/entitlement/trust alternatives), despite passing local signing checks. Roope was asked to check actual developer trust/verification. No Home, GPS, camera, native source UI or release pass is inferred from installation. Exact metadata and procedure: `PHYSICAL_IOS_VALIDATION.md`.
- API health/Metro status/iOS manifest and its exact JS launch asset pass; asset HTTP 200 and **10,956,460 bytes**. Host transport success is not evidence the phone executed it.
- Re-ran full pinned **`pnpm validate`: exit 0**, same **240 tests**, all formatting/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13-route export. Both the initial run and the post-documentation rerun pass; logs: ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/iphone-validate-2026-10-07.log` and `iphone-validate-final-2026-10-07.log`. No new Doctor, registry audit, native release, store, legal or production GO claim; no GitHub push.

## Independent team-baseline location/free-data work — 2026-10-06–07

- Base `39f8aa6`, local `codex/kierratysappi-nearest-location`. No KeepItGreen experiment code/assets copied and no GitHub push. Team checkout is separate from the private checkout.
- **Full pinned `pnpm validate` passes October 7**, exit 0: **240 tests** = 32 Node policy + 208 Vitest application tests in 28 files. Breakdown: domain 52, database 5, localization 4, recycling 8, providers 35, application 15, API 13, mobile 76. Format/lint/strict types, package/API builds and **13** web routes pass. Log: ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/data-validate.log`.
- New tests cover the entire bundled directory contract, import completeness/duplicate/coordinate/licence/access rules, nearest/tie/distance calculations, upstream-data age, foreground permission/cancel/timeout/watcher cleanup and FI/EN configuration. Universal-product regressions cover all three sibling types, fixed URL reconstruction, unsafe host/path/credentials/port/fragment, wrong GTIN/type, loops, shared quota/deadline, pre-cancellation and source-preserving API cache/missing-packaging results.
- Repairs during validation: HTTP fixture initially included a forbidden `country` field (corrected to the real strict API body); a Node filesystem import in the application-layer test was moved to a mobile JSON-contract test; cross-package TypeScript control-flow inference required explicit URL/Response/source types. Final checks pass without `any`, exclusions or loosened gates.
- Live official-source example (from the linked Open Facts tutorial): initial OFF 302 to `fi.openproductsfacts.org`; fixed-origin follow-up to `world.openproductsfacts.org` returns 200, actual source Open Products Facts, zero packaging components. Initial world-only routing failed closed; explicit FI/EN aliases were added with regressions. Beauty and pet-food have simulated contract coverage, **not** a separately verified live barcode.
- Browser at localhost 8093, real API at 3003: Finnish manual entry of the official public example → loading → **Pakkaustiedot puuttuvat**, with Open Products Facts source/link, ODbL 1.0, contributor attribution and 7.10.2026 retrieval date. No invented product name or sorting destination. Scoped Home FI/EN and English privacy inspection shows all four barcode recipients, the optional local-only location notice and legal-draft marker. Finnish nearby intro shows actual 6.10.2026 snapshot date and OSM attribution. No geolocation permission was granted or user position inspected.
- Browser screenshots inspected for the manual form and Finnish Home at the actual 319px viewport; no horizontal document overflow. Existing visual design retained. Browser pointer automation mis-targeted/no-op'd; keyboard Enter successfully exercised submit, close and locale controls. This is not a pointer, native, VoiceOver, dark/large-text, camera or GPS acceptance claim. FI Home restored and temporary viewport override reset. Screenshots were inspected in-tool, not archived as files.
- API was rebuilt and only its verified team-preview process restarted at 3003 with the identified project User-Agent and bounded web origins. Metro remains 8093. Debug still depends on Mac/network; data bundling does not establish a standalone native release.
- Web entry: **3,370,667 bytes / 696,736 gzip**, compared with September's 2,548,479 / 576,724. The bundled point database increases size; the existing 2 MiB warning remains, not a performance pass. Formatter max-size was raised to 3 MB so the full generated source data is checked, not excluded.
- At the end of the data work unit, October 6 Expo-location prebuild/pods passed but Xcode 26.6 compile was interrupted for low disk. Owner-approved October 7 cleanup freed approximately 10 GB and preserved the build/rollback. The later native section above supersedes that pending build/install state, not the still-pending physical location acceptance. No fresh Expo Doctor, registry audit, native release, legal/store approval or production GO is claimed.

## Post-push Expo/security repair — 2026-09-10

- Initial GitHub implementation run `34455323779` passed `pnpm validate` but **failed** Expo Doctor 19/20: required Expo ~57.0.21 and Router ~57.0.20, installed 57.0.19/57.0.18. Security run `34455323825` passed Gitleaks; CodeQL skipped. The first synchronized docs snapshot preceded that CI failure; it is not a claim of a green run.
- Updated only those direct Expo packages within SDK 57. Publication-age check from npm package metadata: both older than 42 hours. No Expo exclusions or age bypass. Added a policy regression retaining mandatory Doctor and preventing suppression.
- The recovered live registry audit returned **20 high / 0 critical / 10 moderate / 1 low** records, including 19 high xmldom records and one high js-yaml record. Narrow compatible transitive update selected xmldom 0.8.15/0.9.12 and js-yaml 4.3.2, all older than 24 hours. Two security-floor regressions plus existing fail-closed/high-advisory fixtures pass (**9/9 dependency-policy tests**).
- Final frozen install, peer check, `expo install --check` and `expo-doctor@1.20.1` **20/20** pass. The initial attempted filtered `pnpm dlx` invocation was invalid; reran from `apps/mobile` using the same command as CI.
- Final full pinned `pnpm validate`: **188 tests** (23 policy + 165 application in 22 Vitest files), formatting/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 12 web routes pass. Final live `pnpm security:audit` **passes**, reporting **0 high, 0 critical, 6 moderate, 1 low**. This closes the old external audit-timeout gate for this run; lower-severity records are retained in `docs/security/DEPENDENCY_RISK_ACCEPTANCE.md`.
- Native regeneration, signing/install, physical/wireless/camera/UI/performance and coverage were not rerun for this patch set. Do not use the old Xcode 26.6 binary or prior UI screenshots as acceptance of updated native dependencies. Remote results must be read for the final patch commit in GitHub Actions.

## Owner-authorized GitHub synchronization — 2026-09-10

- Fresh fetch: no remote-only changes, 13 local-only commits, clean worktree. Default branch `main`, private `roopeaal/KierratysAppi`; no name/visibility/settings changes. Normal fast-forward push succeeded for `87404a0..dd48a62`; `git ls-remote origin refs/heads/main` exactly matched local implementation HEAD `dd48a626f19dcd9cc53fea597df678159aa9e67a`.
- Full pinned `PATH="$PWD/work/pnpm-check-shims.cqbctz:$PATH" pnpm validate` rerun passed: 20 repository policy + 165 application tests (**185 total**), formatting/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 12-route web export. `git diff --check origin/main..HEAD` passed before the push.
- Changed-path inspection found only `.env.example` among environment/credential-artifact filename patterns. Native projects/builds, local work/screenshots and dependency folders remain ignored. No local Gitleaks executable was available; this path check is not a substitute for GitHub's actual secret scan.
- For implementation HEAD `dd48a62`, [Security](https://github.com/roopeaal/KierratysAppi/actions/runs/34455323825) completed successfully: the Gitleaks secrets job passed; CodeQL was explicitly skipped by the existing private-repository gate, not passed. [CI](https://github.com/roopeaal/KierratysAppi/actions/runs/34455323779) was still running `pnpm validate` after checkout/tool setup/frozen installation passed. The follow-up documentation push starts its own checks; inspect the workflow for the exact final HEAD before claiming remote acceptance. No new live dependency-audit, physical/native-build, legal or store pass is implied.

## KeepItGreen display-name change — 2026-09-10

- Baseline: clean `44ca955`. Changed display/localized names and current brand copy only; application identifiers, provider/sorting behavior, storage keys and dependency graph are unchanged.
- Narrow regressions: `node --test scripts/__tests__/app-brand-policy.test.mjs` **3/3** and `corepack pnpm --filter @kierratysappi/localization test` **4/4** pass. The first test draft used two nonexistent localization keys; corrected to the actual `privacyDraft`/`deleteLocalDataBody` keys, then narrow and strict-type/full runs passed.
- Full `PATH="$PWD/work/pnpm-check-shims.cqbctz:$PATH" pnpm validate` with pinned pnpm 11.16.0: **pass**, 20 Node policy + 165 application tests in 22 Vitest files (**185 total**), formatting/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 12 static web routes. No new dependency or live security-audit pass is claimed.
- Browser reproduction: open local Metro web Home, set 390×844 viewport, inspect FI, select English, inspect again, restore FI and open Privacy and terms. Both Home wordmarks and accessible labels read KeepItGreen without clipping; the Finnish page has no document horizontal overflow. Privacy/deletion copy reads KeepItGreenin and the legal-review marker remains visible. No data-deletion action was triggered. Restore Home/FI and reset viewport after QA.
- Ignored local screenshots: `work/ui-qa/2026-09-10-design/keepitgreen-home-fi-390.png` and `keepitgreen-home-en-390.png`. This is browser evidence, not native launcher/VoiceOver/dark-mode acceptance.
- Export entry `entry-653e028d04f09527ac6625cb6a5be84d.js`: **2,548,479 bytes / 576,724 gzip**. The existing bundle warning remains; no performance improvement is claimed.
- Not run: native regeneration/build/install, signing renewal, cable-disconnected device flow or embedded-JS standalone runtime. The previous phone binary/profile is unchanged. Free/wireless procedure and current official sources: `docs/research/ios-free-wireless-development.md`. Release remains **NO-GO**; name rights/store availability need OA-10 approval.

## Visual refresh — 2026-09-10

- Full pinned `pnpm validate` passes: **181 tests** (17 policy + 164 application), format/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 12 exported web routes. No dependency or native-build change.
- Actual browser evidence covers scoped FI/EN Home/manual/result/guide, 320/390/1280 widths, invalid input, real OFF product resolution, controlled unreachable-API offline → local guide and ambiguous local-component guidance. Source/date/version/verification/confidence and OFF attribution remain present. Explicit web radio checked-state regressions were repaired and inspected.
- Screenshots, exact sizes, reproduction and limits: `design-refresh-evidence.md`. The new UI is **not physically accepted**: September 8 XCTest reopen timed out. Dark/largest native text/camera/VoiceOver/performance remain pending. Prior iPhone screenshots below describe the earlier design.

## Xcode 27 evaluation and restored-app smoke — 2026-09-08

- Source baseline `a6af06c`, clean before documentation changes. Xcode 27 beta 6 (`27A5252f`)/iOS 27 SDK fresh Debug compile passes; recursive app and 11 framework signatures pass; physical installation passes. **Runtime fails** immediately with `SIGTRAP` in UIKit's no-scene-lifecycle enforcement. An initial successful launch/PID return is not a startup pass.
- The generated Expo AppDelegate still owns its window through the old app lifecycle. Apple requires UIScene when linking against iOS 27. Xcode 27 app compilation is therefore rejected for this configuration pending migration; see `XCODE_27_VALIDATION.md` for crash evidence, exact sanitized build procedure and official sources.
- Restored the signed Xcode 26.6/iOS 26.5 artifact over the failing app without deleting app data. Finnish Home → manual known-product lookup → Nutella result, unknown 0%/partial 55% confidence, Rinki/FI/checked-date/version/verification and OFF licence/attribution passed through the beta-built automation runner. Terminate/relaunch returned interactive Home.
- Privacy-safe screenshots: ignored `work/ui-qa/2026-09-08-restored-home-ios.png`, `2026-09-08-restored-result-ios.png`, `2026-09-08-restored-provenance-ios.png`. A capture of an unrelated foreground surface was removed immediately and is not evidence.
- Full pinned `pnpm validate` passes: 13 policy + 154 application tests (167 total), format/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 12 web routes. Logs/artifacts: ignored `work/xcode27-device.2T1Y9A/`. No new dependency/live-security-audit pass is claimed.
- Beta device tooling works; app builds continue with explicit Xcode 26.6. System default remains Command Line Tools. Profile expiration remains **2026-09-11 07:01:05 UTC** and the Debug client still needs Metro/API. Camera, VoiceOver, Release/TestFlight, performance and wider matrix were not tested in this run.

## Physical iPhone current-client smoke — 2026-09-07

- Post-evidence repository validation: full `pnpm validate` passed through the isolated Corepack shim at the repository pin, pnpm 11.16.0. Format, lint and strict type checks passed; 13 repository-policy tests plus 154 application tests passed; all package/API builds and the 12-route web export passed.
- Repository identity before this run: local `main` at `77ad397`, nine commits ahead of `origin/main`; no push or publication was performed.
- Host/device identity: Apple M1 on macOS Tahoe 26.7 (`25G227`), Xcode 26.6 (`17F113`), and a connected iPhone 12 Pro Max on iOS 27.0 (`24A5424a`) as reported by `xcdevice`/XCTest.
- Runtime connectivity: the Mac API and Metro health endpoints passed on localhost and LAN address `192.168.10.43`. The installed Expo 57 development client launched through that Metro origin, and the phone established multiple TCP connections to Metro.
- Home: the Finnish Home interactive semantic tree and screenshot passed on the physical iPhone. Evidence: ignored `work/ui-qa/2026-09-07-home-fi-ios.png`.
- Manual entry: the interactive semantic flow reached the manual product-code form and submitted the known valid product lookup. This is functional semantic evidence, not a VoiceOver reading-order or Dynamic Type pass.
- The first known lookup correctly rendered the offline state because the client had loaded a stale 2026-09-04 Metro bundle containing that day's API address. Metro was safely restarted with the current `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`, the client was relaunched, and the same manual flow then resolved normally.
- Answer-first result: the current client preserved one unknown material at **0%** rather than guessing, and showed plastic collection at **55% partial confidence**. Evidence: ignored `work/ui-qa/2026-09-07-known-product-result-top-fi-ios.png`.
- Provenance/result continuation: the lower page showed Rinki source, FI jurisdiction, checked date **2026-08-10**, rule version and verified status, plus Nutella identity. Evidence: ignored `work/ui-qa/2026-09-07-known-product-provenance-fi-ios.png`.
- Scope: this run does **not** pass camera scanning, VoiceOver, release configuration, performance, battery, dark mode, reduced motion, broader barcode cases or other physical-device lanes.

## Historical final rebuild and initial connection failure — 2026-09-04

- Host: macOS Tahoe 26.7 (`25G220`), Xcode 26.6 (`17F113`), local Node 26.4.0. The owner freed disk space; no user data cleanup was performed by Codex.
- Final frozen install, peer check, Expo install check and Doctor 1.20.1 **20/20** pass with the strict release-age policy intact. Expo 57.0.19 / RN 0.86.3 / dev-client 57.0.18 are installed. Isolated Corepack shims under ignored `work/pnpm-check-shims.cqbctz` verified nested pnpm **11.16.0**, avoiding the host's different global pnpm.
- Final `corepack pnpm validate`: **pass, 167 tests** (154 Vitest tests in 22 files plus 13 Node policy tests), formatting, lint, strict types, package/API builds and 12 web routes. Narrow API 12/12 and database 5/5 pass. Earlier concurrent runs exceeded the unchanged 5-second database test timeout while Xcode was compiling; the narrow and complete reruns passed after compilation without relaxing the test.
- Final coverage: **pass**, all 154 application tests. Core statement coverage is unchanged from the table below; mobile is 70.75% statements / 79.51% branches / 57.14% functions / 73.40% lines. SQL migration execution is tested; the JS coverage tool's 0/0 database output is not SQL coverage.
- Final bundle: entry **2,540,918 bytes / 575,233 gzip**; secondary **45,171 / 14,789 gzip**. No device performance claim follows from these sizes.
- Security: fast-uri 3.1.5/4.1.2 upgraded within their allowed major ranges to **3.1.7/4.1.4**. The post-update raw snapshot reports **0 high, 0 critical, 6 moderate, 1 low**. The final live `security:audit` retry **fails closed at 60 seconds**: the official audit POST endpoint also times out independently, while registry metadata GET returns 200. The live gate is externally blocked, not passed. No high/critical exceptions remain; five added regressions cover floors, severity enforcement and valid/invalid report handling.
- Native: live-workspace `expo prebuild --platform ios --no-install` regenerated ignored native files; incidental package-script changes were reverted. `pod install` completed with 111 pods; manifest/lock and JS/native versions agree. Fresh Xcode Debug `iphoneos` build **passes**, recursive app signature and **11/11 framework signatures pass**. Artifact: `work/ios-dev-client-2026-09-04-derived/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/KierrtysAppi.app`; ignored build log is alongside it. Profile expiration: **2026-09-11 07:01:05 UTC**.
- At the time of this 2026-09-04 run, physical install and development-launcher opening **passed**, but the explicit Metro origin showed `Error loading app` / connection refused, so Home/manual/result were not then reverified. Actual historical failure screenshot: `work/ui-qa/2026-09-04-ios-dev-client-connection-error.png`; no camera frame was captured. The later 2026-09-07 section above records the successful current-client connection and smoke.
- On 2026-09-04, API `/v1/health` and Metro `/status` responded correctly on localhost and that day's Mac LAN address, both bound all interfaces, and the macOS firewall permitted the actual Node executable with block-all disabled. No network/firewall setting was changed. The connectivity blocker documented that day was resolved for the 2026-09-07 current-client smoke.

## Earlier startup-only attempt — 2026-09-04

- `corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`: pass with pnpm 11.16.0 after the interrupted eight-package Expo patch update. This is not full update acceptance.
- Local API `GET /v1/health`: pass, `{"status":"ok","version":"0.1.0"}`. Metro `GET /status`: pass, `packager-status:running`. Services were left running.
- Physical launch: **fail**, iOS refused the existing app with a signing/entitlement/trust security error. Extraction of only `ExpirationDate` from the last installed artifact's provisioning profile showed `2026-08-29T13:03:31Z`; `codesign --verify --deep --strict` still passed local artifact integrity. No device identifier, account identifier or signing secret is recorded here.
- Native compatibility remains unverified: installed fixture Expo 57.0.16 / RN 0.86.2 versus current JS Expo 57.0.18 / RN 0.86.3. About 2.3 GiB free disk space was observed; no new native build/install, physical Home pass or complete test suite was run in this startup-only request. No commit was made.

The remainder records the historical 2026-08-28 validation baseline, not a current pass for the updated dependencies.

Evidence date: 2026-08-28. Host: macOS and local Node 26.4.0. The host-global pnpm is 11.19.0, while all final validation commands used `corepack pnpm` at the project pin 11.16.0; production/CI/EAS Node remains pinned to 24.19.0.

## Physical iOS preflight — historical 2026-08-28 baseline

| Command/evidence | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `sw_vers` / host inspection | Apple M1 on macOS 26.5.2 (`25F84`), compatible with current Xcode 26.6 |
| `xcode-select -p` | System selection remains `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`; all native commands explicitly set `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` |
| `xcodebuild -version` | Pass: Xcode 26.6 (`17F113`), iOS 26.5 SDK |
| `xcrun devicectl list devices` | Pass: paired, connected iPhone 12 Pro Max running iOS 26.1; device identifiers are intentionally omitted |
| `pnpm --filter @kierratysappi/mobile exec expo config --type public` | Pass: evaluated bundle/version, permission, locale, privacy and plugin configuration |
| Clean iOS prebuild in ignored `work/` | Pass: native project generated without installing pods |
| Generated deployment/bundle | iOS 16.4; `fi.roopeaaltonen.kierratysappi`; version `0.1.0`, build `1` |
| Generated purpose strings | Finnish/English camera-only text; no microphone or location usage string |
| Generated privacy/entitlements | Empty app entitlements; no tracking/collected types; UserDefaults reason `CA92.1` |
| Debug native compile | Pass on 2026-08-22 and 2026-08-26 for generic `iphoneos`; a fresh 2026-08-28 build also contains `expo-dev-client`/dev-launcher/dev-menu 57.0.16. Dependency build-script warnings were emitted, no build error |
| Recursive signature | Pass: 11/11 embedded frameworks valid; `codesign --verify --deep --strict` passed for the app |
| Physical install/runtime matrix | Partial pass: development installs cover lifecycle, EAN-13, permissions, known/unknown/OFF/offline/retry/cache/provenance and controlled backend-unavailable recovery. The rebuilt development client launches without the earlier null script URL and physically rendered the redesigned Home/manual/answer-first result; see `docs/final/PHYSICAL_IOS_VALIDATION.md` |

Official Expo and Apple requirements were rechecked on 2026-08-28. Expo's current development-build guidance requires an SDK-compatible `expo-dev-client` for the launcher/tooling expected by this profile and requires a rebuild after native dependency changes. Apple requires Xcode 26/iOS 26 SDK uploads and permits local Personal-Team testing with seven-day provisioning limits. The observed profile did expire after seven days; a renewed build/install on 2026-08-22 restored the development run. This is not release/TestFlight evidence.

## Passing evidence — historical 2026-08-28 baseline

| Command/evidence | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` | Pass from the locked dependency graph with pnpm 11.16.0 |
| `corepack pnpm validate` | Pass: format, lint, strict typecheck, 154 application tests plus eight repository-policy regressions, package/API builds and 12-route Expo web export |
| Domain | 48 tests, 3 files |
| PostgreSQL migration/seed | 5 tests, 1 file; full 26-table PGlite execution |
| Data providers | 14 tests, 2 files |
| Recycling engine | 8 tests, 1 file |
| Localization | 3 tests, 1 file |
| Application resolution/cache | 8 tests, 1 file |
| API | 12 tests, 2 files |
| Mobile state/config/storage/contrast/accessibility/presentation | 56 tests, 11 files |
| **Application subtotal** | **154 tests, 22 Vitest files** |
| Repository policy | 8 Node tests covering generated-tree exclusion, strict dependency age, development-client profile/runtime parity, text-input names, dynamic iOS announcements, critical automation IDs and uncapped font scaling |
| **Automated total** | **162 tests** |
| `corepack pnpm test:coverage` | Pass; all 154 application tests reran with coverage |
| `corepack pnpm security:audit` | Pass policy: two exact high build-tool advisories reviewed and accepted only until 2026-09-10 |
| API production smoke | Pass on `127.0.0.1:3107`: health, OpenAPI 429 schema, strict extra-field 400; rejected request log contained only request ID/status/message, not the submitted field/value |
| API bundle inspection | Pass: one 52,431-byte JS file, no sourcemap, no GS1 mock symbol |
| iOS clean prebuild inspection | Pass configuration: localized fi/en camera text, no microphone purpose string, privacy manifest says no tracking/collected types and UserDefaults reason CA92.1 |
| Android clean prebuild inspection | Pass source config: audio/storage/system-alert-window marked remove, `allowBackup=false`; final signed merged manifest remains unverified |
| Store asset source inspection | Pass dimensions/formats: icon/adaptive/splash 1024×1024 PNG; favicon 64×64 PNG |
| GitHub read-only inspection | Private default `main`; latest pushed CI/Security at `87404a0` succeeded; branch protection returns plan-gated 403; no repo variables |

## Coverage evidence — historical 2026-08-28 baseline

Coverage is useful but not a release gate substitute. V8 summaries:

| Package | Statements | Branches | Functions | Lines |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Domain | 91.12% | 84.41% | 94.44% | 90.90% |
| Data providers | 94.07% | 90.82% | 95.83% | 95.07% |
| Recycling engine | 92.42% | 77.55% | 100% | 91.93% |
| Application | 90.54% | 83.33% | 100% | 92.95% |
| API | 95.58% | 91.48% | 93.33% | 97.01% |
| Mobile tested modules | 70.75% | 79.51% | 57.14% | 73.40% |
| Localization | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| Database SQL | Not meaningfully represented by V8 | PGlite behavior tests are the evidence |

Mobile coverage excludes most rendered route/component code; it must not be interpreted as native UI acceptance.

## Live and visual evidence — historical through 2026-08-28

- Real GTIN `3017620422003` resolved through local API → OFF to Nutella with four packaging components. Missing cap material remained unknown. Source, community status, combined ODbL/DbCL, attribution and retrieval date were visible.
- A controlled provider-unavailable fixture produced `Tietolähde ei vastaa` without classifying the product as unknown. After restoring the real API, the same Retry action recovered to Nutella without code re-entry; the API observation remained free of raw GTIN.
- Manual invalid GTIN produced a visible web alert. On physical iOS, VoiceOver exposed two defects: the placeholder became the field name and the alert was silent/interrupted. Explicit localized text-input labels and a high-priority iOS announcement path were added; VoiceOver then announced the correct EAN/GTIN field name/hint/trait and read the full validation instruction automatically.
- A later known-product run rendered Nutella but VoiceOver stayed on `Hae tuote`. The result screen now maps and announces loading plus every terminal lookup state. Six state expectations and repository policy pass; physical confirmation of this repair is deferred while functional and visual testing takes priority.
- Redesigned Home, manual, resolved result, ambiguous result and offline recovery were inspected at 390×844 in Finnish; Home and result also passed English wrapping. Home/result at 1280×720 each measured zero horizontally overflowing DOM elements. Close/internal actions exposed button semantics, external rule/licence/provider sources remained links, and document language followed the UI language.
- Physical iPhone semantic inspection and 1284×2778 screenshots passed the redesigned Finnish Home, manual lookup and answer-first Nutella result. Scanner exposed localized Close and torch buttons; no live-camera screenshot was captured. The development automation toolbar overlaps the torch's top-right hit target, so the actual physical toggle is not claimed.
- Legal showed confirmed all-local-data deletion.
- Web browser state was restored and audit tabs finalized after inspection.
- On the physical iPhone, the same known GTIN resolved through OFF in earlier 343 ms evidence and in the updated UI run; current privacy-safe local observations included a 249 ms live lookup and 5 ms cache hit. The result placed destination/preparation/explanation before product metadata while retaining source/licence/attribution and full rule evidence.
- A physical EAN-13 package decoded and produced a single safe `not_found` result; the privacy-safe server observation completed in 162 ms without raw-GTIN logging.
- Airplane mode produced the offline screen with no API request. Restoring network and retrying recovered without re-entry and returned a cache hit in 8 ms.
- Camera pre-permission explanation, allow, permission revocation while backgrounded, denied recovery UI, deep-link to app settings and permission restoration all worked on-device. Initial system-prompt denial remains unrun.
- Manual `123` produced `Tarkista koodi`, generated no API request and, after repair, announced the complete validation instruction through VoiceOver without requiring focus on the error.

## Bundle/performance evidence — historical 2026-08-28 baseline

- Expo export: 12 static routes.
- Main web entry: 2,539,834 bytes uncompressed; 575,888 bytes gzip. This is 10,242 bytes / 3,604 gzip larger than the prior baseline and remains above budget.
- Secondary web chunk: 45,171 bytes uncompressed; 14,831 bytes gzip.
- The entry exceeds the documented 2 MiB warning threshold. An `agent-device perf frames` attempt returned no matched app process and zero captured frames, so it is invalid evidence; no native startup, memory, frame pacing, camera latency or battery claim is made.

## Compatibility evidence — historical 2026-08-28 baseline

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Explicit supply-chain age policy | `minimumReleaseAge: 1440` and strict enforcement in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; lockfile verification passes |
| `expo install --check` | **Fail as of 2026-08-28:** eight supported patch mismatches. The newest required Expo/constants/font patches are blocked by the strict age gate until 2026-08-29 10:49 UTC; no exclusion/bypass was used |
| Expo Doctor 1.20.1 | **19/20** for the same eight patch mismatches; the other 19 checks pass |
| `corepack pnpm peers check` | Pass: no peer dependency issues |

## Unavailable mandatory evidence

| Check | Actual result | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Android compile/sign/install | Unavailable: no Java runtime, Android SDK/ADB/EAS credentials | External blocker |
| iOS release archive/TestFlight | Development compile/sign/install passes, but no paid-program archive, TestFlight processing or release-configuration install exists | External account/signing/store blocker |
| Physical barcode matrix | Partial: one EAN-13 and permission/recovery paths pass; EAN-8, UPC-A, UPC-E rejection, glare/distance/damage/multiple/rapid cases remain | Physical/manual blocker |
| VoiceOver/TalkBack/large text | Partial iPhone VoiceOver pass: home/scanner/manual-invalid subset; async result repair passes locally but awaits device retest; TalkBack, largest text and remaining recovery flows are unrun | Physical/manual blocker; broader accessibility follows functional/visual work, Android is unavailable |
| Production API/database/monitoring | Does not exist | External infrastructure blocker |
| Backup/restore/load/failover | Not run | External infrastructure blocker |
| Store console/binary validation | Not run | External account/signing blocker |
| Audit-commit remote CI | September 10 `dd48a62` Gitleaks job passes, CodeQL skips; CI is running and final workflow outcome must be checked for the exact HEAD | Remote validation pending, not blocked by missing push authorization |

No unavailable test is recorded as passed by simulation or documentation.
