# Architecture

October 15 adds a separate development-only photo boundary:
mobile camera → metadata-stripped local preview → explicit upload consent →
`POST /v1/recycling/photo` → bounded server-side OpenAI visual observations →
tentative client estimate → local per-part user confirmation → existing sorting
engine. Shared contracts/portable JPEG helpers contain no HTTP/key/device code;
mobile never imports the provider. No bin/rule/product verification comes from
the model. Production/default photo use stays disabled; the key is only in the
ignored server env file, not in the API environment's logged/validated payload.
Existing lookup 2 KiB limit remains; photo route alone has its own 2,001,024-byte
body cap. No image/result cache or persistence; temporary native capture files
are removed before upload and pending/results clear on cancellation/background.
See `PHOTO_RECOGNITION_EVIDENCE.md` for cost limits, retention and current credit/
native acceptance blockers. Development process quotas are not production auth.

Current three-part source organization (October 12): `mobile/` contains app and
localization; `backend/` contains API, resolution/providers and database;
`shared/` contains pure domain/contracts/sorting engine. Mobile consumes
`@kierratysappi/contracts`, not the server application's package. The v1 wire
contract is unchanged. Mandatory AST/public-export/dependency-DAG checks reject
consumer coupling and private paths; scoped validation/CI plus full integration
retain compatibility. Exact responsibility and change procedure:
`docs/project/TEAM_STRUCTURE.md`. Folders do not guarantee zero consumer effects
from deliberate shared changes. No GitHub settings/push is implied.

```text
Expo SDK 57 app
  local Decision 97/129/EC material-code parser → explicit user confirmation
  POST /v1/recycling/lookup
Fastify 5 API
  ProductResolutionService + bounded in-memory cache
  provider order (future internal → licensed GS1 → Open Food Facts)
  normalized ProductObservation with field provenance
  deterministic Finnish Recycling Engine
  discriminated result contract
PostgreSQL 26-table schema for durable product/policy/moderation operations
```

The mobile client imports only the stable lookup schema, never Open Food Facts response shapes. Product observations and sorting policy are separate packages. Provider errors are distinct from not-found. Resolution evaluates each packaging component and caps confidence at the least certain decisive observation even though the rule source is verified.

The typed material-code path never calls the API. A bounded domain parser maps only reviewed official identifiers, then the mobile bridge creates separate user-confirmed and scheme-derived provenance before invoking the same deterministic recycling engine. Recognition can still yield an engine ambiguity or unknown; composites are not promoted to a dominant material.

Open Food Facts requests use a fixed HTTPS origin, v3.6 selected fields, country/language hints, identified User-Agent, manual redirects, 4.5-second timeout and one-megabyte streamed response cap. Results carry source record, URL, retrieval time, verification, confidence and licence snapshot.

The database migration includes identity, providers/observations, packaging/materials, regions/destinations/versioned rules, resolutions/confidence, opt-in scans, feedback/corrections/evidence/moderation, flags and audit events. Published rule versions reject update/delete; sensitive tables force row security and default to no policy.

The API uses POST to keep GTINs out of routine URLs, runtime input/output parsing, 2 KiB request cap, rate limits, secure headers, exact web-origin allowlist, no request access logs, OpenAPI, and bundled workspace code. Deployment remains vendor-neutral.
