# Physical iOS validation

Status date: 2026-10-12

## Source partition smoke — 2026-10-12

After relocation into mobile/backend/shared, restarted owned API/Metro from the
new paths. Existing installed client accepts dev-client launch/reload and shows
actual current Finnish Home; exact **Lähimmät pisteet** visible-button assertion
and ignored 1284×2778 `work/three-part-iphone-home.png` visual inspection pass.
No GPS/camera request or result capture. API/iOS manifest/exact JS asset HTTP 200;
bundle 11,605,710 bytes with current LAN API/nearby code. No new native build,
sign/install/uninstall or wider flow acceptance is inferred. Profile remains
October 19, 12:49:04 Helsinki. New generation/build commands use `mobile/app`;
the ignored local legacy-path symlink is not required by clean checkout/CI.
Complete local tests/scoping: `PROJECT_PARTITION_EVIDENCE.md`. No push.

## Current owner-requested renewal — 2026-10-12

Source `4e79895` on the independent team-baseline branch. This renewal does not
import newer KeepItGreen code/assets or authorize a push/release. Preserved the
existing ID, Personal Team, version 0.1.0/build 1 and native dependencies.

| Check | Result and scope |
| --- | --- |
| Native consistency/build | Pass: Podfile.lock equals Pods/Manifest.lock; Xcode 26.6 `17F113`, iOS 26.5 SDK, Debug generic iOS destination, two build jobs, cached DerivedData and automatic existing-team provisioning produce `BUILD SUCCEEDED` |
| Actual profile renewal | Pass: created 2026-10-12 09:49:04 UTC; expires **2026-10-19 09:49:04 UTC / 12:49:04 Europe/Helsinki**. This is seven-day development provisioning, not a distribution or year-end profile |
| App/framework signatures | Pass: strict recursive app plus all 12 embedded-framework checks; expected device is included; app/profile/team entitlements match |
| Native privacy configuration | Pass: foreground location purpose present, no Always purpose or background modes |
| Replacement installation | Pass: beta CoreDevice install outcome success for the unchanged bundle; no uninstall/reset. Strictly verified previous app retained as rollback, exactly one validated old cached profile moved to a recoverable backup; no revocation or broad cache deletion |
| Physical startup | Pass: CoreDevice accepts launch using current dev-client URL; later exact-PID query still finds the app; no owner trust/account prompt was needed |
| Actual latest Finnish Home | Pass: live XCTest-assisted tree shows scan/manual/plural nearby/guide/history/Privacy; named visible nearby-button assertion passes. Screenshot at 1284×2778 inspected: current baseline icons/tiles/material subtitle render, with development/tool overlays still visible |
| Local-content retention | Not verified: data-container path changes; no private contents inspected or explicitly deleted. Path comparison alone proves neither retention nor loss |
| Runtime host | Pass: restarted API 3003/Metro 8093; LAN health/status/iOS manifest/exact launch asset are healthy. JS bundle HTTP 200, 11,602,981 bytes, latest nearby keys present. This is still a Metro/API-dependent Debug client |
| Latest nearby/material/map/Privacy contents, dark/large text | Not run in this renewal. No GPS or camera acquisition. Home/control presence does not establish these flows, native VoiceOver, accuracy, battery, cable-disconnected or Mac-independent operation |
| Local validation | Pass: pinned `pnpm validate`, 293 tests (47 policy + 246 application), formatting/lint/types, package/API builds and 13-route web export; no new release/Doctor/security-audit/remote-CI claim |

Ignored local evidence under `work/ios-renewal-2026-10-12/`: build/validation logs,
install/inventory/launch/PID metadata, `iphone-home.png`, rollback app and old
profile. Device identifiers/profiles/binaries/screenshots are not committed.
Temporary bootstrap inventory is local OS-temp diagnostics, not analytics.
Keep recovery artifacts through the next successful renewal; remove only exact
validated targets during separately authorized cleanup. No secrets were printed.

Tooling corrections: profile dates/data prevent whole-plist JSON conversion, so
extract selected metadata; parse entitlement JSON rather than dotted-key paths.
CoreDevice executable is a URL, not a string for `CONTAINS`, so use the exact
launched PID predicate. Agent-device resolves the physical device by its observed
name and rejects simulator-only runtime-hint flags; plain physical `open` succeeds
after CoreDevice has launched the dev-client URL. These were diagnostic/tooling
errors, not app failures or reasons to reinstall again.

Next manual renewal must occur before October 19 at 12:49 Helsinki; no recurring
automation has been created. Earlier October 13 and September profile statements
below are historical, not the current installed expiry. Remaining native flow
acceptance and public production gates remain separate.

## Earlier physical evidence — October 8 and before

Latest permission-cycle delta: **DENIAL AND RESTORATION PASS**. Roope changes app-specific permission to Never; native search exposes the complete Finnish denial explanation and settings control. Closing returns to Home. After the owner restores While Using, search reaches the ready-only refresh button with wait exit 0 and explicit visibility pass. No fresh consent-dialog, exact result-text or physical accuracy claim. Earlier pending-denial statements below are historical.

Status: **HOME, NEARBY INTRODUCTION, REPEATED LOCATION READY STATE AND SAME-PROCESS BACKGROUND CLEARING PASS. Exact result text, fresh consent, denial/retry, physical accuracy and native product-source acceptance remain pending. Historical September runtime passes do not certify those flows.**

## Latest recovery — 2026-10-08

Restored stopped Mac API/Metro and relaunched the unchanged installed application.
Two searches reach the ready-only refresh control (exact button selector, wait exit 0).
Home/background then ordinary foreground launch restores the search control while
application PID 7054 remains unchanged. This verifies ready-state clearing, not
a fresh consent-dialog or location accuracy test. Exact explanatory-text selectors
were ambiguous or unmatched and therefore are not recorded as passed. No location
result screenshot, coordinates, nearest-point address or exact distance retained.
Earlier dated failures below remain historical evidence. No product reinstall or push.

This report is deliberately separate from simulator, web and generated-configuration evidence. No physical-device row may become Pass without observing the named build on the recorded iPhone.

## Owner-requested retry — 2026-10-07, 22:07 Finland time

No app/helper rebuild or reinstall in this retry. Existing helper signature,
device-unlocked state and API/Metro health pass. A fresh named session reaches
`AGENT_DEVICE_RUNNER_LISTENER_READY` and returns Home in about 14 seconds. This
resolves the earlier startup-transport failure for this attempt; its intermittent
cause is not proven to be fixed generally.

| Physical scenario | Result | Evidence/limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Current Finnish Home | Pass | Live tree exposes scan/manual/nearby/guide/history/privacy controls; screenshot visibly renders the team-baseline design |
| Home → nearby introduction | Pass | Semantic tap changes route; one-shot local-only explanation, search button, coverage/material/access/hours caution, 6.10.2026 data date and OSM/ODbL attribution are present |
| Default-size visual layout | Scoped pass | Home and intro screenshots inspected at 1284×2778; no visible text clipping. Development gear overlay remains, so these are not store assets or a full visual/large-text/dark-mode pass |
| Start foreground location | Action performed, result unverified | Tapped the observed search control without taking a result screenshot. Alert query found none; safe result/refresh selectors did not match, then the helper reported `system_modal_probe_timeout` and `RUNNER_BUSY` |
| Permission / distance result | Pending | Busy/failed captures do not prove denial, absent result, app crash or successful GPS. Roope was asked to handle any visible prompt (Allow Once) and report result/error without sensitive details |
| Background clearing / denied retry / product-source UI | Not run | Must be independently observed after resolving the pending screen; unit/browser evidence is not a native pass |

Privacy-safe local screenshots under ignored `work/location-2026-10-06/`:
`iphone-home-retry-2026-10-07.png` and
`iphone-nearby-intro-retry-2026-10-07.png`. Both precede the location request.
No permission-map/result screenshot, coordinate, point address or exact distance
was captured. Session diagnostics are under the tool's local
`sessions/team-location-retry-2026-10-07/runner.log`; they record the listener
recovery and later system-modal probe failure, not a passing GPS result.

Full pinned `pnpm validate` passes after recording this retry: 240 tests,
format/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13 routes; log:
`work/location-2026-10-06/iphone-retry-validate-2026-10-07.log`. Closed only the
automation helper/session, verified no runner xcodebuild remains and confirmed
the product still has the same running PID. No product reinstall/reset/termination.

## Earlier post-trust follow-up — 2026-10-07

- Roope reported the trust/verification step complete. Without an app reinstall,
  the explicit development-client deep-link launch returned success, and a
  subsequent filtered process query found KeepItGreen running. The prior iOS
  Security rejection is resolved for this launch; GUI content is not inferred.
- API health and Metro status still pass at the current LAN origins.
- UI automation initially failed because the **separate** cached
  AgentDeviceRunnerUITests runner profile had expired. Rebuilt the existing
  helper with Xcode 27 beta, existing team/IDs and automatic provisioning;
  `TEST BUILD SUCCEEDED`. The renewed helper profile expires October 14 at
  18:51:50 UTC; **the product app still expires October 13 at 18:21:19 UTC**.
- The incremental helper build left the outer runner's resource seal stale
  after changing its embedded profile/test artifacts. Re-signed that exact
  generated runner, preserving its validated identity/entitlements; recursive
  strict signature verification then passed. No app source, bundle, user data,
  global signing configuration or private-repository implementation changed.
- Subsequent fresh-session XCTest startup still timed out without a readable
  app tree. Tool diagnostics reported cancellation/termination of timed-out
  runner processes. The later close attempt found no active automation session.
  This is a tooling failure, **not evidence of an app crash or a GPS failure**.
- Roope was asked whether the phone displays normal Home, an error or a
  permission prompt. Home/location/source UI remain **Not run / awaiting owner
  observation**. No GPS request was automated and no coordinates, nearest-point
  result or camera frame were captured. Use the owner-assisted procedure below
  instead of repeatedly rebuilding the app for a resolved trust problem.
- Full pinned `pnpm validate` again passes: 240 tests, formatting/lint/types,
  package/API builds and 13 routes. Ignored evidence:
  `work/location-2026-10-06/iphone-post-trust-validate-2026-10-07.log`,
  `iphone-launch-after-trust-2026-10-07.json` and
  `runner-renewal-2026-10-07.log`. No release/Doctor/security-audit/GitHub claim.

Owner-assisted procedure: confirm normal Home; open **Lähin kierrätyspaikka** →
**Etsi sijainnillani**, choose foreground permission, and report only whether a
point and distance labelled **Arvio linnuntietä** appear (not the name/address,
coordinates or actual distance). Background and return: the old result should
clear and a new search should be possible. Record observations separately;
denial/retry and product-source UI require their own tests, not an inferred pass.

## Team-baseline development installation — 2026-10-07

Source: local `487af03` on `codex/kierratysappi-nearest-location`, based on team
main `39f8aa6`. No newer KeepItGreen code/assets were imported or pushed. Version
`0.1.0` / build `1`, bundle ID `fi.roopeaaltonen.kierratysappi`, iPhone 12 Pro Max.

| Check | Result and limits |
| --- | --- |
| Native dependency consistency | Pass: iOS Podfile.lock equals Pods/Manifest.lock; Expo 57.0.21 and ExpoLocation 57.0.16 included |
| Xcode 26.6 Debug compile | Pass: `17F113`, generic iOS destination, `-jobs 2`, automatic existing-team provisioning; build exit 0 and `BUILD SUCCEEDED` |
| Signature/profile | Pass: strict recursive app check and all 12 embedded frameworks; app/team entitlements and expected device match embedded development profile |
| Profile expiry | **2026-10-13 18:21:19 UTC / 21:21:19 Europe/Helsinki**; this is not a year-long or distribution profile |
| Location declaration | Foreground purpose present; no Always location purpose or background modes in built Info.plist |
| Installation | Pass: beta `devicectl device install app` over the existing bundle, no uninstall/reset; retained rollback untouched |
| Local content retention | **Not verified**: pre/post app inventory shows a changed data-container path. Path replacement alone proves neither data loss nor retention; no private app contents were inspected |
| Host runtime transport | API health, Metro status, iOS manifest and exact manifest launch asset pass; JavaScript response HTTP 200, 10,956,460 bytes. These are host checks, not phone startup evidence |
| First physical launch | **Rejected**: CoreDevice 10002 → FBS Security reports invalid signature, inadequate entitlements or profile not explicitly trusted. Local integrity/profile checks pass; the specific device cause is not yet confirmed |
| Owner action | Roope: Settings → General → VPN & Device Management → developer profile; trust/verify if offered, then open KeepItGreen and report the result. Codex: relaunch through verified Metro and diagnose further if rejection persists |
| Home/location/product flow | **Not run on this binary** pending launch: allow/deny/retry, distance, background clearing and actual source/unknown UI remain mandatory; do not retain user coordinates/nearby results in logs/screenshots |
| Full repository validation | Pass: 240 tests (32 policy + 208 application), format/lint/strict types, package/API builds and 13 web routes |

Retained ignored evidence is under `work/location-2026-10-06/`: build log
`build-2026-10-07.log`, validation `iphone-validate-2026-10-07.log`, and the
`iphone-{before-install,install,after-install,launch}-2026-10-07.json` metadata.
The native artifact is `DerivedData/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/KeepItGreen.app`.
No signing secrets or user location are included in committed evidence.

SHA-256 of main executable:
`0a258884715cb99d4cd4826ba2e6bf1d929f79dd1cbc78ea87976a223ff9c0ef`.
SHA-256 of development dylib:
`c994df1a6dd66044e61f745bcda14314a98be87bd68a3c919146578e39a99bd8`.
JavaScript remains served by Metro; these native hashes are not a standalone
release-bundle identity. Mac-hosted Metro/API are still required.

The sections below are dated historical evidence, including their old
profile expiries, camera-only configuration and runtime passes.

## Latest toolchain comparison — 2026-09-08

Baseline source: `a6af06c`. Xcode 27 beta 6 (`27A5252f`)/iOS 27 SDK compiled, signed and installed successfully, but its app immediately failed with `SIGTRAP` in UIKit's missing-UIScene enforcement. The new SDK is **not accepted** for current app builds. See `XCODE_27_VALIDATION.md` for the crash report, source and reproduction.

The existing Xcode 26.6 artifact was restored without deleting app data and tested again: Home, manual Nutella lookup, unknown/partial confidence, full Rinki provenance, OFF attribution and terminate/relaunch to Home all pass on September 8. The beta-built XCTest runner could inspect and operate this restored binary. Screenshots: ignored `work/ui-qa/2026-09-08-restored-{home,result,provenance}-ios.png`. Camera, VoiceOver and the broader matrix remain historical/unrun. Profile expiration is still September 11 at 07:01:05 UTC; Metro/API remain required.

The following identity/preflight tables retain the September 7 comparison baseline; they do not certify the rejected beta artifact.

## Test identity

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Repository source | Local `main` at `77ad397`; ahead of `origin/main` by nine commits before this run. No push/publication was performed. |
| App version/build | `0.1.0` / iOS build `1` |
| Bundle identifier | `fi.roopeaaltonen.kierratysappi` |
| Host | Apple M1, macOS Tahoe 26.7 (`25G227`) for the 2026-09-07 run; the 2026-09-04 rebuild used 26.7 (`25G220`) and earlier August evidence used 26.5.2 |
| Xcode | 26.6 (`17F113`), iOS 26.5 SDK; commands use an explicit `DEVELOPER_DIR` because system `xcode-select` remains on Command Line Tools |
| Selected install method | Local Xcode development build and `devicectl` install using automatic Personal-Team signing |
| Signing scope | Apple Personal Team is sufficient for local testing; seven-day provisioning limits apply |
| iPhone model | iPhone 12 Pro Max |
| iOS version | 27.0 (`24A5424a`) for the 2026-09-07 current-client smoke; historical August evidence used 26.1 (`23B82`) |
| Tester | Repository owner for manual observations; Codex for build/device/API/Metro logs |
| Physical run date | 2026-09-07 current-client Home/manual/result smoke; 2026-09-04 fresh signed install/launcher and failed Metro connection; 2026-08-10/22/26/28 earlier-client evidence |
| Screenshots/logs | 2026-09-07 semantic trees, API/Metro/device connection observations and ignored screenshots: `work/ui-qa/2026-09-07-home-fi-ios.png`, `work/ui-qa/2026-09-07-known-product-result-top-fi-ios.png` and `work/ui-qa/2026-09-07-known-product-provenance-fi-ios.png`. Ignored `work/ui-qa/after-home-fi-ios-physical.png` and `after-result-fi-ios-physical.png` are historical 2026-08-28 captures. No live camera frame was captured. |

## Automated preflight evidence

| Check | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Git synchronization | Pass as inspection; not pushed | Before the 2026-09-07 run, local `main` HEAD was `77ad397`, ahead of `origin/main` by nine commits. No push authorization exists and no publication was performed. |
| Host compatibility | Pass | macOS Tahoe 26.7 is in Xcode 26.6's supported macOS 26.2–26.x range; local tool invocation and native build pass. |
| Full Xcode | Pass | Xcode 26.6 and the iOS 26.5 SDK are installed and usable through explicit `DEVELOPER_DIR`. |
| Expo/iOS compatibility | Pass for checked source/build/runtime scope | 2026-09-04 Expo 57.0.19 / RN 0.86.3 / dev-client 57.0.18 passes frozen install, peers, Expo install check and Doctor 20/20 without exclusions; native pod manifest/lock and versions agree. On 2026-09-07 this installed client also reached Home, manual entry and a known-product result through the current Metro bundle. This is not broader native or release acceptance. |
| Native generation | Pass | A clean ignored-workspace `expo prebuild --clean --platform ios --no-install` completed. |
| Bundle/version | Pass | Generated project has bundle ID `fi.roopeaaltonen.kierratysappi`, marketing version `0.1.0` and build `1`. |
| Camera purpose | Pass configuration | Finnish and English `NSCameraUsageDescription` state barcode-only camera use and no frame upload. |
| Unrelated purpose strings | Pass configuration | No microphone or location usage description is generated. Location is not used by the current product. |
| Development compile | Pass | Fresh 2026-09-04 live-workspace generation, 111-pod installation and Xcode Debug `iphoneos` build pass with Expo 57.0.19 / RN 0.86.3 / dev-client 57.0.18. Dependency build-script warnings remain; no build error occurred. |
| Development signature | Pass | All 11 embedded frameworks passed strict signature verification and the app passed recursive `codesign --verify --deep --strict`. This is development evidence, not App Store archive evidence. |
| Development install/launch | Pass for current development smoke | The 2026-09-04 fresh install and launcher/onboarding pass. On 2026-09-07 the same current Expo 57 client launched through Metro at `192.168.10.43`, requested the bundle over multiple phone-to-Mac TCP connections, and passed Home/manual/known-result smoke. The profile is valid until 2026-09-11 07:01:05 UTC. This is development evidence only. |
| Entitlements | Partial | Development signing/install passes. Final archive entitlements remain unverified. |
| Privacy manifest | Pass configuration | No tracking or collected data types; UserDefaults required-reason API uses `CA92.1`. Final dependency-merged archive remains unverified. |
| Icons/splash | Pass generation | App icon, splash logo at 1x/2x/3x, splash background and storyboard are generated from source assets. |
| Appearance/orientation | Pass configuration | Automatic light/dark style; phone portrait scope. iPad remains configured for portrait and landscape. |
| EAS development profile | Source invariant repaired | `developmentClient:true`, internal distribution and Node 24.19.0 exist; the matching `expo-dev-client` dependency and a repository-policy regression now exist. EAS itself was not invoked. |

The current development build is under ignored `work/ios-dev-client-2026-09-04-derived/`, generated from live `apps/mobile/ios`, not stale copied staging. It is a short-lived Personal-Team development artifact, not an archive, TestFlight build or release artifact. The previous profile expired on 2026-08-29; the new profile expires 2026-09-11 07:01:05 UTC. On 2026-09-07 API and Metro health passed on localhost and the current Mac LAN address, and the phone established multiple TCP connections to Metro. The first known-product attempt still displayed offline because the running client had loaded a stale 2026-09-04 Metro bundle containing that day's API address. Metro was safely restarted with the current `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`, the app was relaunched, and the same flow resolved normally. The prior 2026-09-04 connection failure remains historical evidence in ignored `work/ui-qa/2026-09-04-ios-dev-client-connection-error.png`.

## Physical test matrix

Rows not exercised remain **Not run**. `Pass` means the named behavior was observed on the recorded iPhone; it does not generalize to other hardware, release configuration or stores. The current-client evidence is enumerated immediately below. Unless a later row explicitly says **2026-09-07 current client**, its Pass/Partial observation is historical evidence from the 2026-08-10–28 clients and must not be treated as retested on the current Expo 57 binary.

### Current-client smoke — 2026-09-07

| Scenario | Status | Evidence/notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Development launch through current Metro | Pass | API and Metro responded on localhost and LAN address `192.168.10.43`; the phone established multiple TCP connections and rendered the app bundle. |
| Finnish Home | Pass | Interactive semantic tree exposed the expected Home content and actions; screenshot: `work/ui-qa/2026-09-07-home-fi-ios.png`. |
| Manual-entry flow | Pass | The interactive semantic flow reached manual entry and accepted the known valid product lookup. This does not validate VoiceOver reading order or Dynamic Type. |
| Stale development bundle handling | Pass after service correction | The first lookup correctly rendered offline because the already loaded 2026-09-04 Metro bundle contained an old API address. Metro was safely restarted with the current API base and the client was relaunched; no application-data or device-setting mutation was required. |
| Known-product result, answer first | Pass | The repeated lookup resolved and placed component sorting guidance before product identity. The top result preserved one unknown material at 0% and showed plastic collection at 55% partial confidence; screenshot: `work/ui-qa/2026-09-07-known-product-result-top-fi-ios.png`. |
| Known-product provenance | Pass | The lower result retained Rinki/FI source, checked date `2026-08-10`, rule version and verified status alongside Nutella identity; screenshot: `work/ui-qa/2026-09-07-known-product-provenance-fi-ios.png`. |

All camera, lifecycle, VoiceOver, appearance, performance, battery and wider barcode-matrix observations below remain historical or Not run for the 2026-09-07 client.

### Installation and lifecycle

| Scenario | Status | Evidence/notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fresh install and first launch | Pass | Development build installed and launched on 2026-08-10; renewed builds installed/launched on 2026-08-22 and 2026-08-26 |
| Cold start | Partial | Force-quit relaunch reached interactive UI; no release-build tap-to-interactive timing captured |
| Warm start | Not run | Measure from icon tap to interactive home |
| Background → foreground | Pass | Owner confirmed return worked |
| Force quit → relaunch | Pass | Owner confirmed force-quit relaunch worked |
| Lock → unlock while open | Partial | App returned, but a transient development-only Expo CLI warning appeared; DevTools showed a temporary CLI connectivity warning |
| Safe areas and Dynamic Island/notch | Not run | Record device form factor |
| Keyboard avoidance/manual entry | Partial | Standard-size manual input and numeric Search submission worked with VoiceOver; largest text remains unrun |
| Light and dark appearance | Not run | Check all result states |
| Portrait behavior | Not run | Phone is portrait-only by configuration |

### Camera permission

| Scenario | Status | Evidence/notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Context screen appears before system prompt | Pass | Barcode-specific explanation appeared before the iOS prompt |
| Allow camera | Pass | iOS prompt appeared and allowing it opened the live scanner |
| Deny camera | Not run | Manual entry and recovery must remain available |
| Enable later in iOS Settings | Pass | `Avaa asetukset` opened the app settings; re-enabling Camera restored the scanner without a second prompt |
| Revoke while app is backgrounded | Pass | Revoking Camera in Settings changed the scan route to the denied/recovery UI |
| Permission change after force quit | Not run | Requires relaunch |

### Barcode scanner

| Scenario | Status | Evidence/notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Valid EAN-13 | Pass | Physical package decoded and produced the safe `not_found` flow; API recorded one successful `not_found` completion in 162 ms without logging the raw GTIN |
| Valid EAN-8 | Not run | Supported format |
| Valid UPC-A | Not run | Supported format |
| UPC-E/unsupported format | Not run | Must not become a guessed GTIN or start a lookup |
| Malformed/invalid checksum manual value | Pass | Manual `123` showed `Tarkista koodi`; API log remained empty |
| Duplicate callback suppression | Not run | One lookup for rapid identical callbacks |
| Close range | Not run | Record approximate distance |
| Farther range | Not run | Record approximate distance |
| Oblique angles | Not run | Multiple angles |
| Low light | Not run | Record conditions |
| Glare | Not run | Record conditions |
| Partially obscured barcode | Not run | Must not guess |
| Multiple visible barcodes | Not run | Record selected behavior |
| Rapid repeated scans | Not run | Observe haptics and request count |
| Torch control | Partial | The redesigned physical scanner semantic tree exposed localized `Sytytä valo`; the development automation toolbar overlaps the top-right target, so an actual on/off toggle is not claimed |

### Product lookup and network state

| Scenario | Status | Evidence/notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Known Open Food Facts food product | Pass | **2026-09-07 current client:** manual lookup resolved to Nutella after Metro was restarted with the current API base. **Historical 2026-08 client:** the same product resolved through OFF and the provider log completed in 343 ms. |
| Unknown valid GTIN | Pass | Physical EAN-13 showed `Tuotetta ei löytynyt`; no guessed product or sorting answer |
| Slow network | Not run | Use Network Link Conditioner or equivalent |
| Airplane mode/offline | Pass | Same known GTIN showed `Ei verkkoyhteyttä`; no API request was emitted |
| Restore network and retry | Pass | `Yritä uudelleen` recovered to Nutella without re-entering the code |
| Provider timeout/error | Pass for controlled unavailable fixture | Fixture produced provider-unavailable rather than unknown/offline; provider-specific timeout timing remains unrun |
| Backend unavailable | Pass | `Tietolähde ei vastaa` appeared with source-unavailable status; restoring the real backend and pressing Retry recovered to Nutella without code re-entry |
| Change network during lookup | Not run | Wi-Fi/cellular transition if available |
| Background app during lookup | Not run | Result/retry state must remain coherent |
| Cached result | Pass | Restored retry returned a cache hit in 8 ms; result retained cache/source disclosure |
| Stale result behavior | Not run | Requires controlled clock/cache fixture; never present stale as current |
| Malformed API response | Not run | Controlled fixture; must become provider unavailable |
| Long product name | Not run | Controlled fixture and largest text |
| Missing image | Not run | No broken layout or implied image requirement |

### Recycling guidance

| Scenario | Status | Evidence/notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Component-level sorting | Pass for known fixture and redesigned presentation | **2026-09-07 current client:** the top result showed answer-first component guidance, preserved one unknown material at 0%, and showed plastic collection at 55% partial confidence. This remains one product fixture, not full content acceptance. |
| Source/provenance/rule date | Pass for known fixture | **2026-09-07 current client:** the lower result showed Rinki as source, FI jurisdiction, checked date `2026-08-10`, rule version and verified status, with Nutella identity. **Historical 2026-08 client:** product licence/attribution and source links were also exercised. |
| Confidence and verification state | Pass for known fixture | **2026-09-07 current client:** partial confidence was exposed as 55% and the unresolved material remained unknown at 0% rather than receiving a guessed destination. Historical no-source cases also explicitly stated that no verified rule was applied. |
| Ambiguous packaging | Not run | Must ask/retain uncertainty |
| Missing packaging information | Not run | Must remain unknown |
| Confirmed material code | Not run | User confirms visible code |
| Unsupported/composite material code | Not run | Must not guess a destination |

### Accessibility and motion

| Scenario | Status | Evidence/notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dynamic Type through largest accessibility size | Not run | All core flows operable |
| VoiceOver focus order | Partial | Direct-touch navigation passed from home scan action to scanner title/close and back to manual entry. Full sequential swipe order, permission recovery, results and settings remain unverified. |
| VoiceOver labels/traits/hints | Partial | Home scan action announced `Skannaa pakkaus`, button trait and privacy/purpose hint; scanner title and close link were named; manual action and corrected EAN/GTIN text-field name/hint/trait were announced. Remaining screens are unrun. |
| VoiceOver error recovery | Partial | Initial manual-invalid alert was visible but silent, then its first explicit announcement was interrupted by button focus. The locally repaired high-priority iOS announcement was physically confirmed to read the full `Tarkista koodin numerot...` message. Offline/provider states remain unrun. |
| VoiceOver asynchronous lookup result | Failed, repaired locally; retest deferred | Nutella rendered during a known-product run, but VoiceOver remained on `Hae tuote`. Loading and all terminal lookup states now use a pure tested announcement mapping; the device retest is deferred until after functional and visual work. |
| Increase Contrast | Not run | Information remains legible |
| Reduce Motion | Not run | No essential information loss; transitions suppressed |
| Button Shapes/related options | Not run | Actions remain distinguishable |
| Touch targets | Not run | Minimum 44×44 pt |
| Non-color communication | Not run | Confidence/errors/status include text or icon semantics |

### Performance and resilience

| Scenario/metric | Status | Evidence/notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cold-start time | Not run | Xcode release/debug context must be named |
| Camera-open latency | Not run | Measure tap to usable preview |
| Barcode-decode latency | Not run | Physical label, repeated samples |
| Scan-to-result latency | Not run | Separate API/provider latency |
| Visible frame drops | Measurement unavailable | 2026-08-28 xctrace Animation Hitches attempt matched no app process and captured zero frames; its reported zero dropped frames is invalid and not accepted as a pass |
| Memory warnings/leaks | Not run | Xcode memory graph/Instruments if available |
| Unexpected heat | Not run | Record duration and device state |
| Battery impact | Not run | Extended camera session; record duration/percentage/context |
| Excess repeated API requests | Not run | Inspect privacy-safe request counts, not raw GTIN logs |
| Force quit/relaunch recovery | Pass functionally | Development build relaunched after force quit; no performance timing captured |
| Backend/provider failure recovery | Pass functionally | Controlled unavailable response rendered correctly; restoring the API and retrying recovered without re-entry. Current privacy-safe live/cache observations were 249 ms / 5 ms |
| Very large Dynamic Type under failures | Not run | Offline/provider/ambiguity screens |

## Defects and development-only observations

- The first 2026-08-10 Personal-Team artifact contained unsigned embedded frameworks even though the app wrapper was signed. The artifact was repaired by signing all 11 frameworks and re-signing/verifying the app before install. The clean 2026-08-22 Xcode build produced zero unsigned frameworks and passed strict recursive verification without the repair.
- The Personal-Team profile expired after seven days and iOS correctly refused launch. Renewing the Apple account/profile, rebuilding, reinstalling and trusting the renewed developer profile restored launch. This is an expected limitation of free local provisioning and remains unsuitable for distribution.
- After a lifecycle test, the development build displayed `Open debugger to view warnings`; the in-app button did not respond. Mac DevTools showed only a transient inability to reach Expo CLI. Metro then reconnected and no application warning remained. This does not validate production behavior and should be rechecked in a release build.
- On 2026-08-26, the stopped Metro service produced the development-client-only `No script URL provided` screen. Restarting the local API/Metro services and launching with the explicit LAN payload restored the app. This is expected for the development artifact and is not evidence about a self-contained release build.
- Independent inspection then found that `developmentClient:true` had no `expo-dev-client` dependency, so the installed shell was not actually a recoverable development client. A fresh prebuild/pod/Xcode artifact containing dev-client/dev-launcher/dev-menu fixed the null script URL failure; recursive app/framework signature verification, install, launch and Home/manual/result runtime checks passed. The policy test now fails any future mismatched profile.
- Physical VoiceOver testing found that `accessibilityLabelledBy` alone did not name the manual field on iOS: VoiceOver used the placeholder. Explicit localized `accessibilityLabel` values were added to all three text inputs; the manual field then announced `EAN- tai GTIN-koodi`, its text-field trait and hint.
- Physical VoiceOver testing found that a React Native `accessibilityRole="alert"` did not automatically announce the manual validation error on iOS. A centralized iOS announcement path now covers manual validation, material-code/component results, feedback save and local-data deletion. The manual error uses high priority because a queued/default announcement was physically observed to be interrupted; the repaired full announcement passed on the device.
- The later known-product VoiceOver run exposed an equivalent asynchronous state-change gap: Nutella rendered while speech remained on the earlier search button. The result route now explicitly announces loading, offline, invalid, not-found, provider-unavailable, resolved and packaging-missing states through a pure mapping with regression coverage. This source repair has not yet been physically reconfirmed.
- Preflight documentation defect fixed: `docs/quality/MANUAL_TEST_CHECKLIST.md` no longer claims UPC-E is supported and now requires safe rejection.

## Remaining boundary

Device-to-Mac connectivity plus Home/manual/known-result smoke now pass on the installed Expo 57 development client. The current binary still needs the wider camera/barcode matrix, VoiceOver, largest Dynamic Type, dark/reduced-motion, lifecycle and valid performance/battery tests. Release remains blocked until a paid-program release archive/TestFlight build, broader Apple device matrix and all remaining acceptance gates pass.
