# External blockers

These are release blockers or high-risk gates that cannot be completed without external authority, assets, accounts, contracts, devices, infrastructure or an upstream release. Exact procedures and evidence owners are in `docs/final/OWNER_ACTIONS.md`.

October 7 update: OSM point data and Open Facts sibling read routing require no
new paid service/account/key for local implementation. OA-03 licensing/contact
review now explicitly covers beauty, pet-food and other-products recipients;
OA-06 covers foreground-only, ephemeral device location and those transfers.
No approval is inferred. GS1/KIVO remain inactive, not prerequisites for this
local point directory. The Xcode 26.6 build, signatures and installation now pass.
After **Roope** completed the actual trust/verification step, CoreDevice launch
and later app process presence pass: that security rejection is resolved.
**Codex** renewed the separate XCTest helper's expired profile and repaired its
outer signature. On the owner's retry, actual Home and nearby introduction now
pass through the working helper. After starting location, its system-modal/AX
probe times out; **Codex** owns this local tooling recovery, not an app-failure
or external-credential claim. **Roope** handles any actually visible location
prompt and supplies privacy-safe result/error observations under OA-09 when
automation cannot read the screen. Distance/permission acceptance is still open.

| Blocker | Severity | Why external | Owner action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Android signed build/device/Play validation | blocker | No Java runtime, SDK/ADB, device, signing, EAS/Play authority | OA-08 |
| iOS release archive/TestFlight validation | blocker | Local Personal-Team compile/sign/install/core-device flow passes, but paid-program archive, final entitlements/privacy report, TestFlight processing and release authority remain absent | `docs/final/PHYSICAL_IOS_VALIDATION.md`, OA-09 |
| Remaining physical barcode/accessibility/performance/battery evidence | blocker/high | One iPhone development build, EAN-13/core-flow subset and repaired partial VoiceOver path pass; broader iOS matrix and all Android device evidence require continued manual device work | OA-08, OA-09 |
| Production HTTPS API/shared quota/database | blocker | Provider/region/cost/accounts/domain approval absent | OA-01 |
| PostgreSQL backup/restore/RPO/RTO | high | No managed production database or operations owner | OA-02 |
| OFF account/contact/licence approval | high | Owner account/mailbox and legal decision required | OA-03 |
| Rinki/Palpa content/reuse approval | high | Trust-critical human editorial/legal approval required | OA-04 |
| GS1 Data terms/access/decision | high | Commercial contract, cost, rights and credentials absent | OA-05 |
| Privacy/GDPR/terms/hosted URLs | blocker | Controller/legal decisions and publication required | OA-06 |
| Monitoring, alerts, contacts and incident drills | high | Vendor/account/privacy/on-call decisions absent | OA-07 |
| Store screenshots/feature graphic/forms/validation | blocker/high | Depends on signed builds, accounts and approvals | OA-10 |
| Private branch protection/CodeQL | high governance | GitHub plan/Code Security approval; API currently returns 403 and no variable exists | OA-12 |

Photo/OCR/cloud AI remains disabled and is not a launch blocker. Enabling it would create a new privacy, safety, moderation, device-evaluation and legal workstream requiring separate approval.

Resolved 2026-09-10: the npm audit endpoint responds again. It exposed 20 high XML/YAML records, repaired locally through compatible patches; the final live `pnpm security:audit` passes with zero high/critical and six moderate/one low. OA-11 remains a recurring dependency-review gate, not an active external timeout blocker. The new Expo/Router patch set requires a local native rebuild and physical smoke; no new account or paid service is needed merely for these source repairs.

The September 8 Xcode 27 startup failure is **not an external blocker**: UIScene migration is locally executable and tracked in `ROADMAP.md`/D-021. Xcode 26.6's working development artifact has been restored; profile expiry remains September 11. No additional Apple account, payment or macOS upgrade is needed for this recovery. Existing release-account and physical-matrix gates remain unchanged.

September 10 design update: no new account/tool/paid-action blocker was introduced. Physical acceptance of the refreshed UI is pending after an XCTest-session timeout, not passed by historical phone evidence. Codex owns runner recovery and UI repairs; Roope owns any required unlock/trust/profile authorization under OA-09. Browser dark-scheme emulation was unavailable, so only automated dark contrast is recorded. Do not mislabel those evidence gaps as app failures or newly proven external defects.

## Local development recovery — 2026-09-04

September 10 KeepItGreen rename: no new paid/account blocker for changing the display name. Native rebuild and wireless verification are local work, with Roope responsible for any actual unlock/trust/account prompt. Free Personal Team profiles cannot be extended through year-end without seven-day renewals; this is a platform limit, not an app defect. Mac-independent use additionally depends on the existing OA-01 hosting decision. KeepItGreen name availability/brand-rights approval remains under OA-10; neither is claimed verified by this rename. See `docs/research/ios-free-wireless-development.md`.

The old release-age, disk-space, expired-fixture and iPhone-to-Mac connectivity prerequisites are resolved. The owner updated the Mac to Tahoe 26.7 and freed space; Codex installed compatible patches, passed Doctor 20/20 and 167-test validation, rebuilt/signed all 11 frameworks plus app, and installed/launched the new client. On 2026-09-07 the phone connected to the current Metro origin and Home/manual/known-product runtime passed after the stale development API origin was refreshed. Its profile expires 2026-09-11 at 07:01:05 UTC. No user data was deleted. The old image-size dependency and exceptions are gone; newly found fast-uri highs were patched within the existing major ranges. See `NEXT_ACTION.md` and OA-09/OA-11 for the remaining named procedures.
